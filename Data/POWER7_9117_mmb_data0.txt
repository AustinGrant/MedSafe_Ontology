 Beginning troubleshooting and problem analysis This information provides a starting point for analyzing problems. This information is the starting point for diagnosing and repairing servers. From this point, you are guided to the appropriate information to help you diagnose server problems, determine the appropriate repair action, and then perform the necessary steps to repair the server. A system attention light, an enclosure fault light, or a system information light indicates there is a serviceable event (an SRC in the control panel or in one of the serviceable event views) on the system. This information guides you through finding the serviceable event. You can view and print a PDF of this information. You can use problem analysis to gather information that helps you determine the nature of a problem encountered on your system. This information is used to determine if you can resolve the problem yourself or to gather sufficient information to communicate with a service provider and quickly determine the service action that needs to be taken. This is the starting point for repair actions. All repair actions must begin with this procedure. From this point, you are guided to the appropriate information to help you perform the necessary steps to repair the server. The problem determination reference information is provided as an additional resource for problem detection and analysis when you are directed here by your service representative.         
 Beginning problem analysis You can use problem analysis to gather information that helps you determine the nature of a problem encountered on your system. This information is used to determine if you can resolve the problem yourself or to gather sufficient information to communicate with a service provider and quickly determine the service action that needs to be taken. The method of finding and collecting error information depends on the state of the hardware at the time of the failure. This procedure directs you to one of the following places to find error information:The  error logs The operating system's error log The control panel The  The Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) error logs Light path diagnostics If you are using this information because of a problem with your  (), see .

 Import Service Key Before you can import a service key file into an HMC, a service key file must first be created on the Kerberos server for the HMC host. The service key file contains the host principal of the HMC client, for example, host/example.com@EXAMPLE.COM. In addition to KDC Authentication, the host service key file is used to enable password-less SSH (Secure Shell) login using GSSAPI.  For MIT Kerberos V5 *nix distributions, create a service key file by running the kadmin utility on a KDC and using the ktadd command. Other Kerberos implementations may require a different process to create a service key. To import a service key: Open the KDC Configuration task from the HMC Management work pane. From the Actions drop down list, select Import Service Key. Select from one of the following:Local - The service key must be located on removable media currently mounted on the HMC. You must use this option locally at the HMC (not remotely), and you must mount the removable media to the HMC before using this option. Specify the full path of the service key file on the media.  Remote - The service key must be located on a remote site available to the HMC via secure FTP. You can import a service key file from any remote site that has SSH (Secure Shell) installed and running.

 KDC Configuration View the key distribution center (KDC) servers that are used by this HMC for Kerberos remote authentication.  From this task you can do the following:View existing KDC servers Modify existing KDC server parameters including realm, ticket lifetime, and clock skew Add and configure a KDC server on the HMC Remove a KDC server Import a service key Remove a service key Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. Under Kerberos, a client (generally either a user or a service) sends a request for a ticket to the KDC. The KDC creates a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for the client, encrypts it using the client's password as the key, and sends the encrypted TGT back to the client. The client then attempts to decrypt the TGT, using its password. If the client successfully decrypts the TGT (i.e., if the client gave the correct password), it keeps the decrypted TGT, which indicates proof of the client's identity. The tickets have a time availability period. Kerberos requires the clocks of the involved hosts to be synchronized. If the HMC clock is not synchronized with the clock of KDC server, authentication will fail. A Kerberos realm is an administrative domain, site, or logical network that uses Kerberos remote authentication. Each realm uses a master Kerberos database that is stored on a KDC server and that contains information about the users and services for that realm. A realm might also have one or more slave KDC servers, which store read-only copies of the master Kerberos database for that realm. To prevent KDC spoofing, the HMC can be configured to use a service key to authenticate to the KDC. Service key files are also known as keytabs. Kerberos verifies the TGT requested was issued by the same KDC that issued the service key file for the HMC. Before you can import a service key file into an HMC, you must generate a service key for the host principal of the HMC client.  Note: For MIT Kerberos V5 *nix distributions, create a service key file by running the kadmin utility on a KDC and using the ktadd command. Other Kerberos implementations may require a different process to create a service key. You can import a service key file from one of these sources: Removable media that is currently mounted to the HMC, such as optical discs or USB Mass Storage devices. You must use this option locally at the HMC (not remotely), and you must mount the removable media to the HMC before using this option. A remote site using secure FTP. You can import a service-key file from any remote site that has SSH installed and running.     To use Kerberos remote authentication for this HMC, complete the following:You must enable the Network Time Protocol (NTP) service on the HMC and set the HMC and the KDC servers to synchronize time with the same NTP server. You can enable the NTP service on the HMC by accessing the  task under HMC Management.  You must set the user profile of each remote user to use Kerberos remote authentication instead of local authentication. A user that is set to use Kerberos remote authentication will always use Kerberos remote authentication, even when the user logs onto the HMC locally.  You do not need to set all users to use Kerberos remote authentication. You can set some user profiles so that the users can use local authentication only. Use of a service key file is optional. Before using a service key file, you must import it into the HMC. If a service key is installed on the HMC, realm names must be equivalent to the network domain name. The following is an example of creating the service key file on a Kerberos server using the kadmin.local command assuming the HMC hostname is hmc1, the DNS domain is example.com, and the Kerberos realm name is EXAMPLE.COM:  # kadmin_local kadmin.local:  ktadd -k /etc/krb5.keytab host/hmc1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM Using the Kerberos ktutil on the Kerberos server, verify the service key file contents. The output should look like the following:# ktutil  ktutil:  rkt /etc/krb5.keytab  ktutil:  l  slot KVNO Principal ---- ---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------    1    9      host/hmc1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM     2    9      host/hmc1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM  The HMC Kerberos configuration can be modified for SSH (Secure Shell) login without a password using GSSAPI. For remote login without a password through Kerberos to an HMC, configure the HMC to use a service key. Once the configuration is completed use kinit -f  principal to obtain forwardable credentials on a remote Kerberos client machine. Then issue the following command to log in to the HMC without having to enter a password:  $ ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=gssapi-with-mic user@host Display existing KDC servers on the HMC. Add a Key Distribution Center (KDC) server to this HMC. Kerberos authentication on the HMC remains enabled until all KDC servers are removed. Before you can import a service key file into an HMC, a service key file must first be created on the Kerberos server for the HMC host. The service key file contains the host principal of the HMC client, for example, host/example.com@EXAMPLE.COM. In addition to KDC Authentication, the host service key file is used to enable password-less SSH (Secure Shell) login using GSSAPI. Parent topic:

 Manage User Profiles and Access Manage your system users that log on to the HMC. A user profile is a combination of a user ID, server authentication method, permissions, and a text description. Permissions represent the authority levels assigned to the user profile for the objects the user has permission to access. Users can be authenticated using local authentication on the HMC, by using Kerberos remote authentication, or by using LDAP authentication. For more information on setting up Kerberos authentication on the HMC, see . For more information about LDAP authentication, see .  If you are using local authentication, the user ID and password are used to verify a userâs authorization to log on the HMC. The user ID must start with an alphabetic character and consist of 1 to 32 characters. The password has the following rules:  Must begin with an alphanumeric character. Must contain at least seven characters, however, this limit may be changed by your system administrator. The characters should be standard 7-bit ASCII characters. Valid characters to use for the password can be: A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and special characters (~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] \ : " ; â). If you are using Kerberos authentication, specify a Kerberos remote user ID. The user profile includes managed resource roles and task roles that are assigned to the user. The managed resource roles assign permissions for a managed object or group of objects and the task roles define the access level for a user to perform on a managed object or group of objects.

 Remote operations Connect to and use the HMC remotely. Remote operations use the GUI used by a local HMC operator or the command line interface (CLI) on the HMC. You can perform operations remotely in the following ways: Use a remote HMC Use a Web browser to connect to a local HMC Use an HMC remote command line The remote HMC is an HMC that is on a different subnet from the service processor, therefore the service processor cannot be auto discovered with IP multicast.  To determine whether to use a remote HMC or Web browser connected to a local HMC, consider the scope of control that you need. A remote HMC defines a specific set of managed objects that are directly controlled by the remote HMC, while a Web browser to a local HMC has control over the same set of managed objects as the local HMC. The communications connectivity and communications speed is an additional consideration; LAN connectivity provides acceptable communications for either a remote HMC or Web browser control.    A remote HMC gives the most complete set of functions because it is a complete HMC; only the process of configuring the managed objects is different from a local HMC.  If you need occasional monitoring and control of managed objects that are connected to a single local HMC, use a web browser. An example of using the web browser might be an off-hours monitor from home by an operator or system programmer. An alternative to performing tasks on the HMC graphical user interface is using the command line interface (CLI).  Learn about the requirements your web browser must meet to monitor and control the HMC. Perform the necessary steps to prepare to use a web browser to access the HMC. Log in to the HMC remotely from a LAN-connected web browser. Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Using a remote HMC A remote HMC gives the most complete set of functions because it is a complete HMC; only the process of configuring the managed objects is different from a local HMC.  As a complete HMC, a remote HMC has the same setup and maintenance requirements as a local Hardware Management Console. A remote HMC needs LAN TCP/IP connectivity to each managed object (service processor) that is to be managed; therefore, any customer firewall that may exist between the remote HMC and its managed objects must permit HMC to service processor communications to occur. A remote HMC may also need communication with another HMC for service and support.  shows the ports a remote HMC uses for communications. Port Use udp 9900 HMC to HMC discovery  tcp 9920 HMC to HMC commands A remote HMC needs connectivity to IBMÂ® (or another HMC that has connectivity to IBM) for service and support. The connectivity to IBM might be in the form of access to the Internet (through a company firewall), or a dialed connection through a customer-provided switched telephone connection that uses the supplied modem (see ). A remote HMC cannot use the supplied modem for communication with a local HMC or a service processor.  Performance and the availability of the status information and access to the control functions of the service processor depends on the reliability, availability, and responsiveness of the customer network that interconnects the remote HMC with the managed object. A remote HMC monitors the connection to each service processor and attempts to recover any lost connections and can report those connections that cannot be recovered.  Security for a remote HMC is provided by the HMC user-login procedures in the same way as a local HMC. As with a local HMC, all communication between a remote HMC and each service processor is encrypted. Certificates for secure communications are provided, and can be changed by the user if desired (see ).  TCP/IP access to the remote HMC is controlled through its internally managed firewall and is limited to HMC related functions.  Parent topic:

 Using a web browser If you need occasional monitoring and control of managed objects that are connected to a single local HMC, use a web browser. An example of using the web browser might be an off-hours monitor from home by an operator or system programmer. Each HMC contains a web server that can be configured to allow remote access for a specified set of users. If a customer firewall exists between the web browser and the local HMC, the ports must be accessible and the firewall setup to allow incoming requests on these ports.  shows the ports that a web browser needs for communicating with an HMC.  Port Use TCP 443 Secure browser access to web server communication TCP 8443 Secure browser access to web server communication TCP 9960 Browser applet communication TCP 124431 Remote web browser communication 1This port is opened in the HMC firewall when remote access is enabled in HMC Version 7.8.0 and later. This port must also be opened in any firewall that is between the remote client and the HMC. After the HMC is configured to allow web browser access, a web browser gives an enabled user access to all the configured functions of a local HMC, except those functions that require physical access to the HMC, such as those that use the local diskette or DVD media. The user interface that is presented to the remote web browser user is the same as that of the local HMC and is subject to the same constraints as the local HMC.  The web browser can be connected to the local HMC by using a LAN TCP/IP connection and using only encrypted (HTTPS) protocols. Logon security for a web browser is provided by the HMC user-login procedures. Certificates for secure communications are provided, and can be changed by the user (see ).  Performance and the availability of the status information and access to the control functions of the managed objects depends on the reliability, availability, and responsiveness of the network that interconnects the web browser with the local HMC. Because there is no direct connection between the web browser and the individual managed objects, the web browser does not monitor the connection to each service processor, does not do any recovery, and does not report any lost connections. These functions are handled by the local HMC  The web browser system does not require connectivity to IBMÂ® for service or support. Maintenance of the browser and system level is the responsibility of the customer. If the URL of the HMC is specified using the format https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address) and Microsoft Internet Explorer is used as the browser, a hostname mismatch message is displayed. To avoid this message, a Firefox browser is used or a hostname is configured for the HMC, using the Change Network Settings task (see ), and this hostname is specified in the URL instead of an IP address. For example, you can use the format https://hostname.domain_name or https://hostname (for example, using https://hmc1.ibm.com or https://hmc1). Parent topic:          
 Using the HMC remote command line An alternative to performing tasks on the HMC graphical user interface is using the command line interface (CLI).  You can use the command line interface in the following situations: When consistent results are required. If you have to administer several managed systems, you can achieve consistent results by using the command line interface. The command sequence can be stored in scripts and run remotely. When automated operations are required. After you have developed a consistent way to manage the managed systems, you can automate the operations by invoking the scripts from batch-processing applications, such as the cron daemon, from other systems. On a local HMC, you can use the command line interface in a terminal window. To open a terminal window, use the Open Restricted Shell Terminal task from the HMC Management work pane. You must ensure that your script executions between SSH clients and the HMC are secure. You can enable or disable the remote command line interface access to the HMC. Parent topic:          
 Setting up secure script execution between SSH clients and the HMC You must ensure that your script executions between SSH clients and the HMC are secure. HMCs typically are placed inside the machine room where managed systems are located, so you might not have physical access to the HMC. In this case, you can remotely access it using either a remote Web browser or the remote command line interface.   To enable scripts to run unattended between an SSH client and an HMC, the SSH protocol must already be installed on the client's operating system. To enable scripts to run unattended between an SSH client and an HMC, do the following: Enable remote command execution.  For more information, see  On the client's operating system, run the SSH protocol key generator. To run the SSH protocol key generator, do the following:To store the keys, create a directory named $HOME/.ssh (either RSA or DSA keys can be used). To generate public and private keys, run the following command:ssh-keygen -t  rsa The following files are created in the $HOME/.ssh directory:private key: id_rsa public  key: id_rsa.pub The write bits for both group and other are turned off. Ensure that the private key has a permission of 600. On the client's operating system, use ssh and run the mkauthkeys command to update the HMC user's authorized_keys2 file on the HMC by using the following command:ssh hmcuser@hmchostname âmkauthkeys -âadd '<the contents of $HOME/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub>' â â To delete the key from the HMC, can use the following command: ssh hmcuser@hmchostname âmkauthkeys --remove 'joe@somehost' â To enable password prompting for all hosts that access the HMC through ssh, use the scp command to copy the key file from the HMC: scp hmcuser@hmchostname:.ssh/authorized_keys2 authorized_keys2 Edit the authorized_keys2 file and remove all lines in this file. Then copy it back to the HMC: scp authorized_keys2 hmcuser@hmchostname:.ssh/authorized_keys2 Parent topic:

 Logging in to the HMC from a LAN-connected web browser Log in to the HMC remotely from a LAN-connected web browser. Use the following steps to log in to the HMC from a LAN-connected web browser: Ensure that your web browser PC has LAN connectivity to the desired HMC. From your web browser, enter the URL of the desired HMC, using the format https://hostname.domain_name  (for example: https://hmc1.ibm.com) or https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.If this is the first access of the HMC for the current web browser session, you can receive a certificate error. This certificate error is displayed if: The web server contained in the HMC is configured to use a self-signed certificate and the browser has not been configured to trust the HMC as an issuer of certificates,  The HMC is configured to use a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) and the browser has not been configured to trust this CA. In either case, if you know that the certificate being displayed to the browser is the one used by the HMC, you can continue and all communications to the HMC will be encrypted.  If you do not want to receive notification of a certificate error for the first access of any browser session, you can configure the browser to trust the HMC or the CA. In general, to configure the browser, use one of the following methods:You must indicate that the browser will permanently trust the issuer of the certificate By viewing the certificate and installing, to the database of trusted CAs, the certificate of the CA that issued the certificate used by the HMC.    If the certificate is self-signed, the HMC itself is considered the CA that issued the certificate. When prompted, enter the user name and password assigned by your administrator.

 Managing Install Resources Add or remove operating environment installation resources for your HMC. You can use the HMC to deploy a system plan that contains information for installing one or more operating environments on one or more logical partitions. To install an operating environment as part of deploying a system plan, the HMC must be able to access and to use an installation resource for that operating environment.  An operating environment installation resource is the necessary set of installation files for a specific version of an operating environment at a specific release and modification level. The installation resource can be on the local hard drive for the HMC or it can be on a Network Installation Management (NIM) server that the HMC can access.  When you define and create a local installation resource, you must meet the following prerequisites: You can define only one local installation resource for a specific operating environment version and modification level.  The HMC must have enough free hard disk space for the necessary set of operating environment installation files. The HMC creates the installation resource in the same local hard drive location that the HMC uses for main store dumps. Consequently, it is recommended that you maintain a certain amount of free hard drive space to avoid potential main store dump problems because main store dumps are necessary to help resolve some types of HMC errors. The typical main store dump averages between 4 to 8 gigabytes (GB), so consider maintaining at least 10 GB of free hard drive space for these dumps when you define and create local installation resources for the HMC.  You must have the operating environment installation media available to copy to the HMC local hard drive. The type of media that you need varies based on the type of operating environment you want to be able to install. You can use CDs or DVDs as the installation image source for Red Hat and SLES operating environments. However, you can use DVDs only as the installation image source for  Virtual I/O Server operating environments.  When you define a remote NIM server installation resource, you must meet a number of prerequisite conditions to ensure that the HMC can access and use the installation resource: The complete set of necessary operating environment installation files must exist on the NIM server within a uniquely named NIM resource group.  You can define a remote resource for  Virtual I/O Server operating environments only.  You can define multiple remote installation resources for a specific operating environment version and modification level, as long as each installation resource is within a different NIM named resource group.  You must know the fully qualified host name of the NIM server. You must know the resource group name that contains the necessary set of operating environment installation files.  You must set up the HMC to be able to access the NIM server and use the operating environment installation files during system plan deployment. The HMC must be able to run secure shell commands by means of an ssh connection to access the NIM server successfully. Consequently, you must ensure that the HMC can provide an appropriate cryptographic key to the NIM server by completing the following steps: Open an HMC command prompt and run the following command to generate the RSA keys that the HMC needs for ssh connections and to place the keys in an accessible file in the HMC HOME directory: ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /home/hscroot/ssh_keys. This command creates two files: one called  and one called  that contain the needed RSA keys. The  file contains the private key that the HMC needs for establishing an ssh connection and this file needs to remain in the /home/hscroot subdirectory; the  file contains the public key that the NIM server must have to complete the ssh connection with the HMC.  On the remote NIM server, append or copy the content of the  file into the  file on the NIM server.   Remote clients defined on the NIM server remain in place after installation of the operating environment on a partition for post installation management. The short hostname of the system will identify this remote client.  Each installation resource that you define and create for the HMC is available for selection in the  step of the Deploy System Plan Wizard. If the installation resource that you want to use for a selected partition is not available when you perform this step, you can click New Install Resource to open the Manage Install Resources window to define and create a new installation resource.

   as a DHCP server You can use the  as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.   If you are using IPv6, the discovery process must be done manually. For IPv6, there is no automatic discovery. For more information about how to configure the  as a DHCP server, see . This figure shows a redundant HMC environment with two managed systems. The first HMC is connected to the first port on each FSP, and the redundant HMC is connected to the second port on each HMC. Each HMC is configured as a DHCP server, using a different range of IP addresses. The connections are on separate private networks. As such, it is important to ensure that no FSP port is connected to more than one HMC. Each managed system's FSP port that is connected to an HMC requires a unique IP address. To ensure that each FSP has a unique IP address, use the HMC's built-in DHCP server capability. When the FSP detects the active network link, it issues a broadcast request to locate a DHCP server. When correctly configured, the HMC responds to that request by allocating one of a selected range of addresses.  If you have multiple FSPs, you must have your own LAN switch or hub for the HMC to FSP private network. Alternately, this private segment can exist as several ports in a private virtual LAN (VLAN) on a larger managed switch. If you have multiple private VLANs, you must ensure that they are isolated and that there is not any crossover traffic.  If you have more than one HMC, you must also connect each HMC to the logical partitions, and to each other, on the same open network. This figure shows two HMCs connected to a single managed server on the private network and to three logical partitions on the public network. You can have an additional Ethernet adapter for the HMC to have three network interfaces. You can use this third network as a management network or connect it to the CSM (Cluster Systems Manager) Management Server. For more information about how to configure the  as a DHCP server, see .

 Types of  network connections Learn how to use the  remote management and service functions using your network. The  supports the following types of logical communications:  Used to perform most of the hardware management functions, in which  issues control function requests through the service processor of the managed system. The connection between the HMC and the service processor is sometimes referred to as the service network. This connection is required for managed system management. Used to collect platform-related information (hardware error events, hardware inventory) from the operating systems running in the logical partitions, as well as to coordinate certain platform activities (dynamic LPAR, concurrent repair) with those operating systems. If you want to use service and error notification features, you must create this connection. Provides remote users with access to  functions. Remote users can access the  in the following ways: By using the Web browser to access all the  GUI functions remotely By using Secure Socket Shell (SSH) to access the  command line functions remotely Used to transmit data, such as hardware error reports, inventory data, and microcode updates, to and from your service provider. You can use this communications path to make automatic service calls. Your HMC can support up to four separate physical Ethernet interfaces, depending on the model. The stand-alone version of the HMC supports only three HMC interfaces, using one integrated Ethernet adapter and up to two plug-in adapters. Use each of these interfaces in the following ways:   Even though the network interfaces into the service processors are encrypted for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol and password-protected, having a separate dedicated network can provide a higher level of security for these interfaces. An open network interface would typically be used for the network connection between the  and the logical partitions on the managed systems, for the -to-logical partition communications. You can also use this open network interface to manage the HMC remotely. Optionally, you can use a third interface to connect to logical partitions and manage the HMC remotely. This interface can also be used as a separate  connection to different groups of logical partitions. For example, you might want to have an administrative LAN that is separate from the LAN on which all the usual business transactions are running. Remote administrators could access s and other managed units using this method. Sometimes the logical partitions are in different network security domains, perhaps behind a firewall, and you might want to have different  network connections into each of those two domains.

 Private and open networks in the HMC environment The HMC can be configured to use open and private networks. Private networks allow the use of a selected range of nonroutable IP-addresses. A public, or "open" network describes a network connection between the HMC to any logical partitions and to other systems on your regular network. Private networksThe only devices on the HMC private network are the HMC itself and each of the managed systems to which that HMC is connected. The HMC is connected to each managed system's FSP (Flexible Service Processor).  On most systems, the FSP provides two Ethernet ports labeled  and . This allows you to connect up to two HMCs.  Some systems have a dual-FSP option. In this situation, the second FSP acts as a "redundant" backup. The basic setup requirements for a system with two FSPs are essentially the same as those without a second FSP. The HMC must be connected to each FSP, so additional network hardware is required (for example, a LAN switch or hub) when there is more than one FSP or there are multiple managed systems.  Each FSP port on the managed system must be connected to only one HMC. Public networks The open network can be connected to a firewall or router for connecting to the Internet. Connecting to the Internet allows the HMC to "call home" when there are any hardware errors that need to be reported. The HMC itself provides its own firewall on each of its network interfaces. A basic firewall is automatically configured when you run the HMC Guided Setup wizard, but you customize your firewall settings after the initial HMC installation and configuration.

 Preparing for  configuration Use this section to gather required configuration settings that you need to know before you begin the configuration steps.  To configure the HMC, you must understand the related concepts, make decisions and prepare information. This section describes the information you will need to connect your HMC to the following:Service processors in your managed systems Logical partitions on those managed systems Remote workstations Service, to implement âcall-homeâ functions  Additional connectivity and security information is available. For more information, see   To prepare for HMC configuration, do the following: Obtain and install the latest level of the HMC code version you want to install.  Determine the physical location of the HMC in relation to the servers it will manage. If the HMC is more than 25 feet from its managed system, you must provide web browser access to the HMC from the managed system's location so that service personnel can access the HMC. Identify the servers that the HMC will manage. Determine whether you will use a private or an open network to manage servers.  If you decide to use a private network, use DHCP, unless you are using a Cluster Systems Management (CSM) configuration. CSM does not support IPv6. To access CSM, you must have two networks. For more information about CSM, see the documentation that was provided with that feature. For more information about private and open networks, see . If you will use an open network to manage an FSP, you must set the FSP's address manually through the Advanced System Management Interface menus. A private, non-routable network is recommended. If you have two HMCs, designate a primary and secondary HMC. The primary HMC should be physically closer to the machine, and should be the HMC that is configured to call home. Determine the network settings that you will need to connect the HMC to remote workstations, logical partitions, and network devices.  Define how the HMC will âcall home.â Call home options include either over an outbound-only Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Internet connection, a modem, or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection.

 Choosing an Internet Protocol Determine the IP address version used when the HMC connects to your service provider. Most users use Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) to connect to a service provider. IPv4 addresses appear in the format representing the four bytes of the IPv4 address, separated by periods (for example, 9.60.12.123) to access the Internet. You can also use Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) to connect to a service provider. IPv6 is often used by network administrators to ensure unique address space. If you are unsure of the Internet Protocol used by your installation, contact your network administrator. For more information about using each version, see  and .  Parent topic:

 Deciding which connectivity method to use for the call-home server Learn more about the connectivity options you have when you use the call-home server. You can configure the HMC to send hardware service related information to IBM by using a LAN-based Internet connection, or a dial-up connection over a modem.  You have two communication choices when configuring the LAN based Internet connection.  The first choice is to use standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The SSL communication can be enabled to connect to the Internet through your proxy server. SSL connectivity is more likely to be compliant with corporate security guidelines. Your second option is to use a VPN connection.  If your open network interface connection uses only Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), you cannot use Internet VPN to connect to support. For more information about the Protocols used, see . The advantages to using an Internet connection can include: Significantly faster transmission speed Reduced customer expense (for example, the cost of a dedicated analog telephone line) Greater reliability   The following security characteristics are in effect, regardless of the connectivity method chosen: Remote Support Facility requests are always initiated from the HMC to IBM. An inbound connection is never initiated from the IBMÂ® Service Support System. All data transferred between the HMC and the IBM Service Support System are encrypted using a high-grade encryption. Depending upon the connectivity method chosen, it is encrypted using either SSL or IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).  When initializing the encrypted connection the HMC authenticates the target destination as that of the IBM Service Support System. Data sent to the IBM Service Support System consists solely of information about hardware problems and configuration. No application or customer data is transmitted to IBM. Using an indirect Internet connection with a proxy serverIf your installation requires the HMC to be on a private network, you may be able to connect indirectly to the Internet using an SSL proxy, which can forward requests to the Internet. One of the other potential advantages of using an SSL proxy is that the proxy may support logging and audit facilities.  To forward SSL sockets, the proxy server must support the basic proxy header functions (as described in RFC 2616) and the CONNECT method. Optionally, basic proxy authentication (RFC 2617) may be configured so that the HMC authenticates before attempting to forward sockets through the proxy server.  For the HMC to communicate successfully, the client's proxy server must allow connections to port 443. You can configure your proxy server to limit the specific IP addresses to which the HMC can connect. See  for a list of IP addresses. Using a direct Internet SSL connectionIf your HMC can be connected to the Internet, and the external firewall can be set up to allow established TCP packets to flow outbound to the destinations described in ,  you can use a direct Internet connection.

 Internet SSL address lists Learn about the addresses the HMC uses when it is using Internet SSL connectivity. The HMC uses the following IPv4 addresses to contact IBM service and support when it is configured to use Internet SSL connectivity. The following IPv4 addresses are for all locations: 129.42.26.224 129.42.34.224 129.42.42.224 170.225.15.41 129.42.56.216 129.42.58.216 129.42.60.216 The following IPv4 addresses are for the Americas: 129.42.160.48 129.42.160.49 207.25.252.200 207.25.252.204 The following IPv4 addresses are for all locations other than the Americas: 129.42.160.48 129.42.160.50 207.25.252.200 207.25.252.205  When configuring a firewall to allow an HMC to connect to these servers, only the IP addresses specific to the geographic region are required. The HMC uses the following IPv6 addresses to contact IBM service and support when it is configured to use Internet SSL connectivity: 2620:0:6C0:1::1000  2620:0:6C1:1::1000  2620:0:6C2:1::1000 Parent topic:          
 Using multiple call-home servers This topic describes what you need to know when you decide to use more than one call-home server. To avoid a single point of failure, configure the HMC to use multiple call-home servers. The first available call-home server attempts to handle each service event. If the connection or transmission fails with this call-home server, the service request is retried using the other available call-home servers until one is successful or all have been tried.  The connected HMC that has been identified by problem analysis to be the primary analyzing console for a given managed system will report the problem. This primary console will also replicate the problem report to any secondary HMC. This secondary HMC must be recognized on the network by the primary HMC. A secondary HMC is recognized by the primary HMC as an additional call-home server when:The primary HMC is configured to use "discovered" call-home servers and the call-home server is either on the same subnet as the primary HMC or it manages the same system The call-home server has been manually added to the list of call-home server consoles available for outbound connectivity Parent topic:

  or  The information provided in this topic defines specific sections of a location code string. Use this information to understand the meaning of a location code. Using location codesUse the following table to link to a specific topic that you need additional information about when reading your location code. Location code topics Description Contains background information on the use of location codes. Provides a definition for physical location code. Provides a definition of what a logical location code is. Provides descriptive information of the Un value in the location code string. For example, U789C.001.  Provides a table that identifies and defines the location code labels. The location code labels begin with an alphabetic character and follow the system serial number. For example, U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23. The system serial number is 10ABCDE in the previous example. P3, C31, T2, and L23 all contain an alphabetic character that is identified in the Location code labels table. Provides a definition for the world unique identifier. This group of digits follows the resource code labels and always begins with the letter W. Location code overviewServers (system unit and expansion units) use physical location codes to provide mapping of replaceable units. Location codes are produced by the server's firmware, which structures them so that they can be used to identify specific parts in a system. The location code format is the same for all servers. If you are working with a specific location code, the unit type and model immediately follow the first character (Utttt.mmm). Match the unit type and model to a link, as shown in the Unit type and locations table. If the location code ends with , the server's firmware could not identify the physical location. When a physical location cannot be identified, a logical location code is provided. Where logical location codes occur in enclosures, the locations topic for the enclosure has the known conversions listed. For logical location codes with no conversion, contact your next level of support. If the location code begins with , the expansion I/O unit's machine type, model, and serial number have not been set yet and this is a temporary unit identifier. To identify the unit, examine the display panels on all of the expansion I/O units that are connected to the server until you find one with the same characters in the first 5 digits of the top line in the unit's display. Record the unit's real machine type and model from the unit label.   Match the unit's machine type and model in the Unit type and locations table and follow the link to determine the service information.  Locations for units that are not in the preceding list are either not supported or there is a problem in the firmware. Contact your next level of support. Physical location codesPhysical location codes provide a mapping of logical functions and components (such as backplanes, removable modules, connectors, ports, cables, and devices) to their specific locations within the physical structure of the server. Logical location codesIf the physical location cannot be mapped to a physical location code, the server's firmware generates a logical location code. A logical location code is a sequence of location labels that identifies the path that the system uses to communicate with a given resource.  A resource has as many logical location codes as it has logical connections to the system. For example, an external tape device connected to two I/O adapters has two logical location codes. An example of a logical location code is: U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23 The first part of the location code (through the T2 label) represents the physical location code for the resource that communicates with the target resource. The remainder of the logical location code (L23) represents exactly which resource is indicated. Location code formatThe location code is an alphanumeric string of variable length, consisting of a series of location identifiers, separated by a dash.  An example of a physical location for a fan is Un-A1.  The first position, represented by Un (where n is equal to any string contained between the U and the hyphen) in the preceding example, is displayed in one of the forms in the following table.  In location codes the U is a constant digit; however, the numbered positions that follow the U are variables and are dependent on your server. Each column defines the numbers that follow the U in the beginning of the location code.  Machine type and model number in a location code Feature codes and sequence numbers in a location code  Utttt.mmm.sssssss-A1  Uffff.ccc.sssssss-A1 The leftmost code is always U. The leftmost code is always U. tttt represents the unit type of the enclosure (drawer or node). ffff represents the feature code of the enclosure (drawer or node). mmm represents the model of the enclosure. ccc represents the sequence number of the enclosure . sssssss represents the serial number for the enclosure. sssssss represents the serial number of the enclosure.   The mmm or ccc number might not be displayed on all location codes for all servers. If the mmm value is not displayed, the location code is displayed in one of the following forms: Utttt.sssssss-A1 Uffff.sssssss-A1 The location code is hierarchical; that is, each location identifier in the string represents a physical part. The order (from left to right), in which each identifier is shown, allows you to determine which parts contain other parts in the string. The dash (-) separator character represents a relationship between two components in the unit. In the example of the fan, whose location code is Un-A1, the dash shows that the fan (A1) is contained in the base unit (or Un). Modules, adapters, cables, and devices are all parts that are plugged into another part. Their location codes always show that they are plugged into another part as components of the server. Another example follows: Un-P1-C9 is a memory DIMM (C9) that is plugged into a backplane (P1), which is inside the unit (Un).  For devices, certain error conditions might cause an  device to display the device location in an  format. Unit type (Utttt.mmm) Link to location information U8202.E4B or U8205.E6B  or   Location code labelsThe location code label represents a physical part of the server. The following table describes the prefixes of location code labels.  These labels apply to system units only. Prefix Description Example A Air-moving device Fan, blower C Card connector IOP, IOA, DIMM, processor card D Device Diskette, control panel E Electrical Battery, power supply, ac charger L Logical path SAS target Integrated drive electronics (IDE) address, Fibre Channel LUN N Horizontal placement for an empty rack location Â  P Planar System backplane T Port, external cable Â  U Unit Â  V Virtual planar Â  W Worldwide unique ID Â  X EIA value for an empty rack location Â  Y Firmware FRU Â  Worldwide unique identifierThe location code label for the worldwide unique identifier consists of the prefix W followed by a maximum of 16 uppercase hexadecimal digits with no leading zeros. A location code might not consist of a worldwide unique identifier. When present, the worldwide unique identifier location label follows the location label of the resource that interfaces with the resource that has the worldwide unique identifier, usually a port.

 PCI bus isolation using or the management console Isolate a PCI bus problem from the management console or while running in the  environment. If you have a management console, then this procedure should be performed from the management console as part of the management console directed service.If you do not have a management console, then you should perform this procedure when directed by the maintenance package. Parent topic:  Isolating a PCI bus problem while running    Perform .   Choose from the following: If you are running , go to   to isolate the PCI bus failure with online diagnostics in concurrent mode. If you are running , go to  to isolate the PCI bus failure with stand-alone diagnostics.    Isolating a PCI bus problem from the management console To isolate a PCI bus problem from the management console, check the serviceable event view for the server for FRU part locations associated with the serviceable event, then continue with this procedure:   Use those locations to exchange the given FRUs one at a time until the problem is resolved.   Continue with the next step.     Continue with the next step.  The multi-adapter bridge number and the multi-adapter function number have not been identified, and so the card slot cannot be identified using the DSA. Look in the management console partition resources for non-reporting or non-operational hardware. That will indicate which cards in which positions need to be replaced. See  for the model you are working on for information about the multi-adapter bridge that controls those card slots. That multi-adapter bridge is also a FRU.    Continue with the next step.  Only the multi-adapter bridge number has been identified. Record the multi-adapter bridge number (left-most character of Cc) for later use. Because the card slot cannot be identified with the DSA, see   for the model you are working on for information about the multi-adapter bridge that controls the card slots. Consider all card slots controlled by the multi-adapter bridge to be FRUs.   Then return to the procedure that sent you here.          
 MABIP52 This procedure will isolate a failing PCI adapter from a reference code when an IPL is not successful on the system or logical partition.  Power off the partition to remove and replace any failing items referenced in this procedure. If you do not perform dedicated maintenance, the problem will persist.   See  for help in determining these values.  The PCI bridge set is the group of card positions controlled by the same multi-adapter bridge on the bus that you recorded.    Be sure to record the card position of each IOA so that you can reinstall it in the same position later. To determine the location of all the IOA cards in the PCI bridge set, go to .

  or  The information provided in this topic defines specific sections of a location code string. Use this information to understand the meaning of a location code. Using location codesUse the following table to link to a specific topic that you need additional information about when reading your location code. Location code topics Description Contains background information on the use of location codes. Provides a definition for physical location code. Provides a definition of what a logical location code is. Provides descriptive information of the Un value in the location code string. For example, U789C.001.  Provides a table that identifies and defines the location code labels. The location code labels begin with an alphabetic character and follow the system serial number. For example, U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23. The system serial number is 10ABCDE in the previous example. P3, C31, T2, and L23 all contain an alphabetic character that is identified in the Location code labels table. Provides a definition for the world unique identifier. This group of digits follows the resource code labels and always begins with the letter W. Location code overviewServers (system unit and expansion units) use physical location codes to provide mapping of replaceable units. Location codes are produced by the server's firmware, which structures them so that they can be used to identify specific parts in a system. The location code format is the same for all servers. If you are working with a specific location code, the unit type and model immediately follow the first character (Utttt.mmm). Match the unit type and model to a link, as shown in the Unit type and locations table. If the location code ends with , the server's firmware could not identify the physical location. When a physical location cannot be identified, a logical location code is provided. Where logical location codes occur in enclosures, the locations topic for the enclosure has the known conversions listed. For logical location codes with no conversion, contact your next level of support. If the location code begins with , the expansion I/O unit's machine type, model, and serial number have not been set yet and this is a temporary unit identifier. To identify the unit, examine the display panels on all of the expansion I/O units that are connected to the server until you find one with the same characters in the first 5 digits of the top line in the unit's display. Record the unit's real machine type and model from the unit label.   Match the unit's machine type and model in the Unit type and locations table and follow the link to determine the service information.  Locations for units that are not in the preceding list are either not supported or there is a problem in the firmware. Contact your next level of support. Physical location codesPhysical location codes provide a mapping of logical functions and components (such as backplanes, removable modules, connectors, ports, cables, and devices) to their specific locations within the physical structure of the server. Logical location codesIf the physical location cannot be mapped to a physical location code, the server's firmware generates a logical location code. A logical location code is a sequence of location labels that identifies the path that the system uses to communicate with a given resource.  A resource has as many logical location codes as it has logical connections to the system. For example, an external tape device connected to two I/O adapters has two logical location codes. An example of a logical location code is: U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23 The first part of the location code (through the T2 label) represents the physical location code for the resource that communicates with the target resource. The remainder of the logical location code (L23) represents exactly which resource is indicated. Location code formatThe location code is an alphanumeric string of variable length, consisting of a series of location identifiers, separated by a dash.  An example of a physical location for a fan is Un-A1.  The first position, represented by Un (where n is equal to any string contained between the U and the hyphen) in the preceding example, is displayed in one of the forms in the following table.  In location codes the U is a constant digit; however, the numbered positions that follow the U are variables and are dependent on your server. Each column defines the numbers that follow the U in the beginning of the location code.  Machine type and model number in a location code Feature codes and sequence numbers in a location code  Utttt.mmm.sssssss-A1  Uffff.ccc.sssssss-A1 The leftmost code is always U. The leftmost code is always U. tttt represents the unit type of the enclosure (drawer or node). ffff represents the feature code of the enclosure (drawer or node). mmm represents the model of the enclosure. ccc represents the sequence number of the enclosure . sssssss represents the serial number for the enclosure. sssssss represents the serial number of the enclosure.   The mmm or ccc number might not be displayed on all location codes for all servers. If the mmm value is not displayed, the location code is displayed in one of the following forms: Utttt.sssssss-A1 Uffff.sssssss-A1 The location code is hierarchical; that is, each location identifier in the string represents a physical part. The order (from left to right), in which each identifier is shown, allows you to determine which parts contain other parts in the string. The dash (-) separator character represents a relationship between two components in the unit. In the example of the fan, whose location code is Un-A1, the dash shows that the fan (A1) is contained in the base unit (or Un). Modules, adapters, cables, and devices are all parts that are plugged into another part. Their location codes always show that they are plugged into another part as components of the server. Another example follows: Un-P1-C9 is a memory DIMM (C9) that is plugged into a backplane (P1), which is inside the unit (Un).  For devices, certain error conditions might cause an  device to display the device location in an  format.

A location code might not consist of a worldwide unique identifier. When present, the worldwide unique identifier location label follows the location label of the resource that interfaces with the resource that has the worldwide unique identifier, usually a port.

 Planning for logical partitions You can create logical partitions to distribute resources within a single server and make it function as if it were two or more independent servers. Before creating logical partitions, you must assess your current and future needs. You can then use this information to determine the hardware configuration that will meet your current needs and serve as a base for meeting your future needs.  Planning for logical partitions is a multistep process. Here are the recommended tasks for planning for logical partitions. Â  Â  __ Compile a list of the questions that you must answer before you create logical partition on an existing system or place your order for new hardware. The following is the list of questions: What are your existing workloads? How many resources do these workloads currently require (during typical usage and at peak usage)? What are your future needs? How will your existing workloads grow over the life of your system? How many new workloads will you have to support over the life of your system?  Do you have an existing system onto which you can consolidate the workloads? Must you upgrade the existing system before you consolidate the workloads? Does it make more sense to purchase a new system for these workloads? What physical infrastructure will you have to support any new hardware? Can your current location accommodate the new hardware? Must you upgrade your power infrastructure or your cooling infrastructure? Will your new hardware work with your existing hardware? Which hardware features will you use? For example, do you want to use virtual I/O to consolidate I/O resources? Must you obtain activation codes or enablement codes to use these features? Must you obtain additional licenses to run your applications? If so, how many additional licenses do you need? Does the support strategy for you new hardware differ from the support strategy for your existing hardware? If so, what changes must you make to maximize the effectiveness of the new support strategy? Must you migrate your workloads onto new hardware? If so, what must you do to migrate these workloads? __ Your system has many features that allow you to use system resources more efficiently and simplify daily tasks.

Trusted Boot uses the Virtual Trusted Platform Module (VTPM) as described by the Trusted Computing Group. Up to 60 logical partitions per server can be configured to have their own unique VTPM by using the  (). The VTPM is used to record the system boot and, in association with the  Trusted Execution technology, provides security and assurance of the boot image on disk, on the entire operating system, and in the application layers.  With  () Version 2.2.1.4 or later, and  processor-based servers with firmware at level 7.4, or later, you can use the Trusted Firewall feature. Trusted Firewall is a feature of the PowerSC Editions. You can use the Trusted Firewall feature to provide a virtual firewall that allows network filtering and control within the local server. The virtual firewall improves performance and reduces the consumption of network resources by allowing direct and secure network traffic between logical partitions that are on different VLANs of the same server. Review the requirements for the system,  (VIOS), logical partitions, and paging space devices so that you can successfully configure shared memory.  When you suspend a logical partition, the operating system and applications running on the logical partition are also suspended, and its virtual server state is stored in persistent storage. At a later time, you can resume the operation of the logical partition. There are certain configurations requirements to make a logical partition capable of suspension.  Before planning to suspend a logical partition, verify that the server supports partitions that are capable of partition suspension by using the  ().

You can view the logical port limit and the owner of the single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) adapter by using the  (). Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to plan for the shared memory pool, the shared memory partitions, the paging space devices, and the  logical partitions (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions).  You need to consider the degree to which you want to overcommit the physical memory in the shared memory pool, the performance of the workloads when running in a shared memory configuration that is overcommitted, and the minimum and maximum boundaries of the shared memory pool. If you use  licensed programs on a server with logical partitions, consider how many software licenses are required for your logical partition configuration. Careful consideration of your software might help minimize the number of software licenses that you must purchase. Each logical partition requires at least a certain amount of hardware resources. You can assign hardware resources directly to a logical partition, or you can set the logical partition to use the hardware resources that are assigned to another logical partition. The minimum hardware configuration requirements for each logical partition depend on the operating system or software installed on the logical partition. Parent topic:          
 Logical partition overview Logical partitioning is the ability to make a server run as if it were two or more independent servers. When you logically partition a server, you divide the resources on the server into subsets called logical partitions. You can install software on a logical partition, and the logical partition runs as an independent logical server with the resources that you have allocated to the logical partition.  You can assign processors, memory, and input/output devices to logical partitions. You can run  and the  in logical partitions. The  provides virtual I/O resources to other logical partitions with general-purpose operating systems. Logical partitions share a few system attributes, such as the system serial number, system model, and processor feature code. All other system attributes can vary from one logical partition to another. You must use tools to create logical partitions on your servers. The tool that you use to create logical partitions on each server depends on the server model and the operating systems and features that you want to use on the server. When you create logical partitions on your server, you can consolidate servers, share system resources, create mixed environments, and run integrated clusters. Although each logical partition acts as an independent server, the logical partitions on a server can share some kinds of resources with each other. The ability to share resources among many logical partitions allows you to increase resource utilization on the server and to move the server resources to where they are needed.  A managed system is a single physical server plus the resources that are connected to the physical server. The physical server and the connected resources are managed by the physical server as a single unit. Connected resources can include expansion units, towers, and drawers, and storage area network (SAN) resources that are assigned to the server. The manufacturing default configuration is the initial single partition setup of the managed system as received from your service provider.  You must use tools to create logical partitions on your servers. The tool that you use to create logical partitions on each server depends upon the server model and the operating systems and features that you want to use on the server. When you create logical partitions on a managed system, you can assign the physical resources on the managed system directly to logical partitions. You can also share hardware resources among logical partitions by virtualizing those hardware resources. The methods used to virtualize and share hardware resources depend on the type of resource that you are sharing. Learn how to integrate  with  applications and data. You can use the logical partitioning examples to consolidate servers, use computing resources more efficiently, and increase the flexibility of your enterprise. Parent topic:          
 Benefits of logical partitioning When you create logical partitions on your server, you can consolidate servers, share system resources, create mixed environments, and run integrated clusters. The following scenarios illustrate the benefits of partitioning your server: Consolidating servers A logically partitioned server can reduce the number of servers that are needed within an enterprise. You can consolidate several servers into a single logically partitioned system. This eliminates the need for, and expense of, additional equipment. Sharing resources You can quickly and easily move hardware resources from one logical partition to another as needs change. Technologies such as the  technology, allow for processor resources to be shared automatically among logical partitions that use a shared processor pool.  Other technologies, such as dynamic partitioning, allow for resources to be manually moved to, from, and between running logical partitions without shutting down or restarting the logical partitions.   Maintaining independent servers Dedicating a portion of the resources (disk storage unit, processors, memory, and I/O devices) to a logical partition achieves logical isolation of software. If configured correctly, logical partitions also have some hardware fault tolerance.   Creating a mixed production and test environment You can create a combined production and test environment on the same server. The production logical partition can run your main business applications, and the test logical partition is used to test software. A failure in a test logical partition, while not necessarily planned, does not disrupt normal business operations.  Merging production and test environments Partitioning enables separate logical partitions to be allocated for production and test servers, eliminating the need to purchase additional hardware and software. When testing has been completed, the resources allocated to the test logical partition can be returned to the production logical partition or elsewhere as required. As new projects are developed, they can be built and tested on the same hardware on which they are eventually deployed.  Running integrated clusters Using high-availability application software, your partitioned server can run as an integrated cluster. You can use an integrated cluster to protect your server from most unscheduled failures within a logical partition. Although there are many benefits to creating logical partitions, consider the following points before choosing to use logical partitions: Processor and memory failures might result in the failure of the entire server with all of its logical partitions. (The failure of a single I/O device affects only the logical partition to which the I/O device belongs.) To reduce the possibility of system failure, you can use the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) to set the server to unconfigure failing processors or memory modules automatically. After the server unconfigures the failing processor or memory module, the server continues running without using the unconfigured processor or memory module. Administering a consolidated system might be more difficult in some ways than administering multiple smaller systems, particularly if the resources in the consolidated system are used at a level close to their capacity. If you anticipate that you will use your server at a level close to its capacity, consider ordering a server model that is capable of Capacity on Demand (CoD).

 Sharing resources between logical partitions Although each logical partition acts as an independent server, the logical partitions on a server can share some kinds of resources with each other. The ability to share resources among many logical partitions allows you to increase resource utilization on the server and to move the server resources to where they are needed.  The following list illustrates some of the ways in which logical partitions can share resources. For some server models, the features mentioned in this list are options for which you must obtain and enter an activation code: The  technology (or shared processing) allows logical partitions to share the processors in shared processor pools. Each logical partition that uses shared processors is assigned a specific amount of processor power from its shared processor pool. By default, each logical partition is set so that the logical partition uses no more than its assigned processor power. Optionally, you can set a logical partition so that the logical partition can use processor power that is not being used by other logical partitions in its shared processor pool. If you set the logical partition so that it can use unused processor power, the amount of processor power that the logical partition can use is limited by the virtual processor settings of the logical partition and by the amount of unused processor power available in the shared processor pool that is used by the logical partition. The Dynamic partitioning feature allows you to manually move resources to, from, and between running logical partitions without shutting down or restarting the logical partitions. This allows you to share devices that logical partitions use occasionally. For example, if the logical partitions on your server use an optical drive occasionally, you can assign a single optical drive to multiple logical partitions as a desired device. The optical drive would belong to only one logical partition at a time, but you can use dynamic partitioning to move the optical drive between logical partitions as needed.  Virtual I/O allows logical partitions to access and use I/O resources on other logical partitions. For example, virtual Ethernet allows you to create a virtual LAN that connects the logical partitions on your server to each other. If one of the logical partitions on the server has a physical Ethernet adapter that is connected to an external network, you can configure the operating system of that logical partition to connect the virtual LAN with the physical Ethernet adapter. This allows the logical partitions on the server to share a physical Ethernet connection to an external network. A  (HEA), or Integrated Virtual Ethernet (IVE), allows multiple logical partitions on the same  to share a single physical Ethernet adapter. Unlike most other types of I/O devices, you can never assign the HEA itself to a logical partition. Instead, multiple logical partitions can connect directly to the HEA and use the HEA resources. This allows these logical partitions to access external networks through the HEA without having to go through an Ethernet bridge on another logical partition. The single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) specification defines extensions to the PCI ExpressÂ® (PCIe) specification. SR-IOV allows virtualization of the physical ports of an adapter so that the ports can be shared by multiple partitions that are running simultaneously. For example, a single physical Ethernet port appears as several separate physical devices. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Shared processors Shared processors are physical processors whose processing capacity is shared among multiple logical partitions. The ability to divide physical processors and share them among multiple logical partitions is known as the  technology.  For some models, the  technology is an option for which you must obtain and enter a  activation code.  By default, all physical processors that are not dedicated to specific logical partitions are grouped together in a shared processor pool. You can assign a specific amount of the processing capacity in this shared processor pool to each logical partition that uses shared processors. Some models allow you to use the  to configure multiple shared processor pools. These models have a default shared processor pool that contains all the processors that do not belong to logical partitions that use dedicated processors or logical partitions that use other shared processor pools. The other shared processor pools on these models can be configured with a maximum processing unit value and a reserved processing unit  value. The maximum processing unit  value limits the total number of processing unit  that can be used by the logical partitions in the shared processor pool. The reserved processing unit  value is the number of processing units that are reserved for the use of uncapped logical partitions within the shared processor pool. You can assign partial processors to a logical partition that uses shared processors. Processing units are a unit of measure for shared processing power across one or more virtual processors. One shared processing unit on one virtual processor accomplishes approximately the same work as one dedicated processor.  The minimum number of processing units depends on the firmware level.Firmware level Minimum number of processing units per virtual processor Version 7.4, or earlier 0.10 Version 7.6, or later 0.05 Some server models allow logical partitions to use only a portion of the total active processors on the managed system, so you are not always able to assign the full processing capacity of the managed system to logical partitions. This is particularly true for server models with one or two processors, where a large portion of processor resources is used as overhead.  When the firmware is at level 7.6, or later, overall server performance can be impacted when there are too many virtual processors configured on the managed system. You can verify the number of configured virtual processors by using the  command from the  command line. The result of the  command might look like the following output:lshwres -m sysname -r proc --level sys -F curr_sys_virtual_procs,max_recommended_sys_virtual_procs 4,240 where:curr_sys_virtual_procs indicates the current number of configured virtual processors.  max_recommended_sys_virtual_procs indicates the recommended maximum number of configured virtual processors. It is suggested that the number of configured virtual processors not exceed the maximum number so that server performance is not affected.  On -managed systems, shared processors are assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. Logical partitions that use shared processors can have a sharing mode of capped or uncapped.  An uncapped logical partition is a logical partition that can use more processor power than its assigned processing capacity. The amount of processing capacity that an uncapped logical partition can use is limited only by the number of virtual processors assigned to the logical partition or the maximum processing unit  allowed by the shared processor pool that the logical partition uses. In contrast, a capped logical partition is a logical partition that cannot use more processor power than its assigned processing units.  For example, logical partitions 2 and 3 are uncapped logical partitions, and logical partition 4 is a capped logical partition. Logical partitions 2 and 3 are each assigned 3.00 processing units and four virtual processors. Logical partition 2 currently uses only 1.00 of its 3.00 processing units, but logical partition 3 currently has a workload demand that requires 4.00 processing units. Because logical partition 3 is uncapped and has four virtual processors, the server firmware automatically allows logical partition 3 to use 1.00 processing units from logical partition 2. This increases the processing power for logical partition 3 to 4.00 processing units. Soon afterwards, logical partition 2 increases its workload demand to 3.00 processing units. The server firmware therefore automatically returns 1.00 processing units to logical partition 2 so that logical partition 2 can use its full, assigned processing capacity once more. Logical partition 4 is assigned 2.00 processing units and three virtual processors, but currently has a workload demand that requires 3.00 processing units. Because logical partition 4 is capped, logical partition 4 cannot use any unused processing units from logical partitions 2 or 3. However, if the workload demand of logical partition 4 decreases below 2.00 processing units, logical partitions 2 and 3 could use any unused processing units from logical partition 4. By default, logical partitions that use shared processors are capped logical partitions. You can set a logical partition to be an uncapped logical partition if you want the logical partition to use more processing power than its assigned amount.  Although an uncapped logical partition can use more processor power than its assigned processing capacity, the uncapped logical partition can never use more processing units than its assigned number of virtual processors. Also, the logical partitions that use a shared processor pool can never use more processing units than the maximum processing units configured for the shared processor pool. If multiple uncapped logical partitions need additional processor capacity at the same time, the server can distribute the unused processing capacity to all uncapped logical partitions.  This distribution process is determined by the uncapped weight of each of the logical partitions.    Uncapped weight is a number in the range of 0 through 255 that you set for each uncapped logical partition in the shared processor pool. On the , you can choose from any of the 256 possible uncapped weight values.   By setting the uncapped weight (255 being the highest weight), any available unused capacity is distributed to contending logical partitions in proportion to the established value of the uncapped weight.  The default uncapped weight value is 128. When you set the uncapped weight to 0, no unused capacity is distributed to the logical partition. Uncapped weight is only used where there are more virtual processors ready to consume unused resources than there are physical processors in the shared processor pool. If no contention exists for processor resources, the virtual processors are immediately distributed across the logical partitions independent of their uncapped weights. This can result in situations where the uncapped weights of the logical partitions do not exactly reflect the amount of unused capacity.  For example, logical partition 2 has one virtual processor and an uncapped weight of 100. Logical partition 3 also has one virtual processor, but an uncapped weight of 200. If logical partitions 2 and 3 both require additional processing capacity, and there is not enough physical processor capacity to run both logical partitions, logical partition 3 receives two additional processing units for every additional processing unit that logical partition 2 receives. If logical partitions 2 and 3 both require additional processing capacity, and there is enough physical processor capacity to run both logical partitions, logical partition 2 and 3 receive an equal amount of unused capacity. In this situation, their uncapped weights are ignored. The server distributes unused capacity among all of the uncapped shared processor partitions that are configured on the server, regardless of the shared processor pools to which they are assigned.  For example, you configure logical partition 1 to the default shared processor pool. You configure logical partition 2 and logical partition 3 to a different shared processor pool. All three logical partitions compete for the same unused physical processor capacity in the server, even though they belong to different shared processor pools.

 Processors A processor is a device that processes programmed instructions. The more processors that you assign to a logical partition, the greater the number of concurrent operations that the logical partition can run at any given time. You can set a logical partition to use either processors that are dedicated to the logical partition or processors that are shared with other logical partitions. If a logical partition uses dedicated processors, then you must assign processors (in increments of whole numbers) to the logical partition. A logical partition that uses dedicated processors cannot use any processing capacity beyond the processors that are assigned to the logical partition.  By default, all physical processors that are not dedicated to specific logical partitions are grouped together in a shared processor pool. You can assign a specific amount of the processing capacity in this shared processor pool to each logical partition that uses shared processors. Some models allow you to use the  to configure multiple shared processor pools. These models have a default shared processor pool that contains all the processor resources that do not belong to logical partitions that use dedicated processors or logical partitions that use other shared processor pools. The other shared processor pools on these models can be configured with a maximum processing unit value and a reserved processing unit value. The maximum processing unit value limits the total number of processors that can be used by the logical partitions in the shared processor pool. The reserved processing unit value is the number of processing units that are reserved for the use of uncapped logical partitions within the shared processor pool. You can set a logical partition that uses shared processors to use as little as 0.10 processing units, which is approximately a 10th of the processing capacity of a single processor.  You can specify the number of processing units to be used by a shared processor logical partition down to the 100th of a processing unit. Also, you can set a shared processor logical partition so that, if the logical partition requires more processing capacity than its assigned number of processing units, the logical partition can use processor resources that are not assigned to any logical partition or processor resources that are assigned to another logical partition but that are not being used by the other logical partition. (Some server models might require you to enter an activation code before you can create logical partitions that use shared processors.) You can assign up to the entire processing capacity on the managed system to a single logical partition, if the operating system and server model supports doing so. You can configure your managed system so that it does not comply with the software license agreement for your managed system, but you will receive out-of-compliance messages if you operate the managed system in such a configuration.  Automatic redistribution of work when a processor failsIf the server firmware detects that a processor is about to fail, or if a processor fails when the processor is not in use, then the server firmware creates a serviceable event. The server firmware can also unconfigure the failing processor automatically, depending upon the type of failure and the unconfiguration policies that you set up using the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI). You can also unconfigure a failing processor manually using the ASMI. When the server firmware unconfigures a failing processor, and there are no unassigned or unlicensed processors available on the managed system, the processor unconfiguration can cause the logical partition to which the processor is assigned to shut down. A logical partition can take processors only from logical partitions with lower partition-availability priorities. If all of the logical partitions on your managed system have the same partition-availability priority, then a logical partition can replace a failed processor only if the managed system has unlicensed or unassigned processors.   By default, the partition-availability priority of  logical partitions with virtual SCSI adapters is set to 191. The partition availablity priority of all other logical partitions is set to 127 by default.    Do not set the priority of  logical partitions to be lower than the priority of the logical partitions that use the resources on the  logical partition.    If the managed system shuts down a logical partition because of its partition availability priority, all logical partitions that use the resources on that logical partition are also shut down.  If a processor fails when the processor is in use, then the entire managed system shuts down. When a processor failure causes the entire managed system to shut down, the system unconfigures the processor and restarts. The managed system attempts to start the logical partitions that were running at the time of the processor failure with their minimum processor values, in partition-availability priority order, with the logical partition with the highest partition-availability priority being started first. If the managed system does not have enough processor resources to start all of the logical partitions with their minimum processor values, then the managed system starts as many logical partitions as it can with their minimum processor values. If there are any processor resources remaining after the managed system has started the logical partitions, then the managed system distributes any remaining processor resources to the running logical partitions in proportion to their desired processor values.  Dedicated processors are whole processors that are assigned to a single logical partition.  Shared processors are physical processors whose processing capacity is shared among multiple logical partitions. The ability to divide physical processors and share them among multiple logical partitions is known as the  technology. A virtual processor is a representation of a physical processor core to the operating system of a logical partition that uses shared processors.  The minimum number of processing units of a logical partition depends on the firmware level and the version of the operating system that is running on the logical partition.

 Dedicated processors Dedicated processors are whole processors that are assigned to a single logical partition.  If you choose to assign dedicated processors to a logical partition, you must assign at least one processor to that logical partition. Likewise, if you choose to remove processor resources from a dedicated logical partition, you must remove at least one processor from the logical partition. On systems that are managed by a  (), dedicated processors are assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. By default, a powered-off logical partition using dedicated processors has its processors available to uncapped logical partitions that use shared processors.  If the uncapped logical partition needs additional processor resources, the uncapped logical partition can use the idle processors that belong to the powered-off dedicated logical partition, if the total number of processors used by the uncapped logical partition does not exceed the virtual processors assigned to the uncapped logical partition, and if the use of these idle processors does not cause the shared processor pool to exceed its maximum processing units. When you power on the dedicated logical partition while the uncapped logical partition is using the processors, the activated logical partition regains all of its processing resources. If you use the , you can prevent dedicated processors from being used in the shared processor pool by disabling this function in the partition properties panels. You can also set the properties of a logical partition using dedicated processors so that unused processing cycles on those dedicated processors can be made available to uncapped logical partitions while the dedicated processor logical partition is running. You can change the processor sharing mode of the dedicated processor logical partition at any time, without having to shut down and restart the logical partition.

 Partition profile A partition profile is a record on the  () that specifies a possible configuration for a logical partition. When you activate a logical partition using a partition profile, the managed system attempts to start the logical partition using the configuration information in the partition profile.  A partition profile specifies the desired system resources for the logical partition and the minimum and maximum amounts of system resources that the logical partition can have. The system resources specified within a partition profile includes processors, memory, and I/O resources. The partition profile can also specify certain operating settings for the logical partition. For example, you can set a partition profile so that, when the partition profile is activated, the logical partition is set to start automatically the next time that you power on the managed system. Each logical partition on a managed system that is managed by an  has at least one partition profile. If desired, you can create additional partition profiles with different resource specifications for your logical partition. If you create multiple partition profiles, you can designate any partition profile on the logical partition to be the default partition profile. The  activates the default profile if you do not select a specific partition profile to be activated. Only one partition profile can be active at one time. To activate another partition profile for a logical partition, you must shut down the logical partition before you activate the other partition profile.  A partition profile is identified by the logical partition ID and partition profile name. Logical partition IDs are whole numbers used to identify each logical partition that you create on a managed system, and partition profile names identify the partition profiles that you create for each logical partition. Each partition profile on a logical partition must have a unique partition profile name, but you can use a partition profile name for different logical partitions on a single managed system. For example, logical partition 1 cannot have more than one partition profile with a partition profile name of normal, but you can create a normal partition profile for each logical partition on the managed system. When you create a partition profile, the  shows you all of the resources available on your system.  The  does not verify if another partition profile is currently using a portion of these resources.  Therefore, it is possible for you to over commit resources. When you activate a logical partition using a partition profile, the system attempts to start the logical partition using the resources that are specified in the partition profile. If the minimum resources specified in the partition profile are not available on the managed system, the logical partition cannot be started using the partition profile.   For example, you have four processors on your managed system.  Logical partition 1 with partition profile A has three processors, and logical partition 2 with partition profile B has two processors.  If you attempt to activate both of these partition profiles at the same time, logical partition 2 with partition profile B fails to activate because you have over committed processor resources. When you shut down a logical partition and reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile, the partition profile overlays the resource specifications of the logical partition with the resource specifications in the partition profile. Any resource changes that you made to the logical partition using dynamic partitioning are lost when you reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile. This is desirable when you want to undo dynamic partitioning changes to the logical partition. However, this is not desirable if you want to reactivate the logical partition using the resource specifications that the logical partition had when you shut down the managed system. It is therefore best to keep your partition profiles up to date with the latest resource specifications. You can save the current configuration of the logical partition as a partition profile. This allows you to avoid having to change partition profiles manually. If you shut down a logical partition whose partition profiles are not up to date, and the logical partition is set to start automatically when the managed system starts, you can preserve the resource specifications on that logical partition by restarting the entire managed system using the partition autostart power-on mode. When the logical partitions start automatically, the logical partitions have the resource specifications that the logical partitions had when you shut down the managed system. You must activate a logical partition by activating a partition profile at least once. After that, you can activate the logical partition based on its current configuration data that is saved in the hypervisor. Logical partitions start faster when activated based on their current configuration data than when activated with a partition profile. When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of processor resources that you want for the logical partition.  When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory resources that you want for the logical partition.  I/O devices are assigned to partition profiles on a slot-by-slot basis. Most I/O devices can be assigned to a partition profile on the  as required or as desired. You can create partition profiles on your  that specify all of the resources on the managed system. If you activate a logical partition using such a partition profile, then the managed system assigns all of its resources to the logical partition. Parent topic:  Related tasks:         
 Processor resource assignment in partition profiles When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of processor resources that you want for the logical partition.  The desired value is the resource amount that the logical partition gets if you do not over commit the resource on the managed system. If the desired amount of resources is available when you activate the partition profile, then the logical partition starts with the desired amount of resources. However, if the desired amount of resources is not available when you activate the partition profile, then the resources on your managed system are over committed. If the amount of resources that are available on the managed system is equal to or greater than the minimum amount of resources in the partition profile, then the logical partition starts with the available amount of resources. If the minimum amount of resources is not met, then the logical partition does not start. If the managed system allows the configuration of multiple shared processor pools, then you can limit the number of processors that are used by a specific group of logical partitions by configuring a shared processor pool for those logical partitions and reassigning those logical partitions to that shared processor pool.  If you create a partition profile that is set to use shared processors, the  calculates a minimum, maximum, and desired number of virtual processors for the partition profile. The calculation of virtual processors is based upon the minimum, maximum, and desired number of processing units that you specify for the partition profile. By default, the virtual processor settings are calculated as follows:The default minimum number of virtual processors is the minimum number of processing units (rounded up to the next whole number). For example, if the minimum number of processing units is 0.8, the default minimum number of virtual processors is 1.  The default desired number of virtual processors is the desired number of processing units (rounded up to the next whole number). For example, if the desired number of processing units is 2.8, the default desired number of virtual processors is 3.  The default maximum number of virtual processors is the maximum number of processing units rounded up to the next whole number and multiplied by two. For example, if the maximum number of processing units is 3.2, the default maximum number of virtual processors is 8 (four times 2).  When you activate the logical partition using the partition profile on the , the logical partition is assigned the desired number of virtual processors. You can then use dynamic partitioning to change the number of virtual processors to any number between the minimum and maximum values, so long as the number of virtual processors is greater than the number of processing units that are assigned to the logical partition. Before changing the default settings, performance modeling should be performed. For example, you create a partition profile on the  with the following processor unit settings. Minimum processing units 1.25  Desired processing units 3.80  Maximum processing units 5.00  The default virtual processor settings for this partition profile on the  are as follows. Minimum virtual processors 2  Desired virtual processors 4  Maximum virtual processors 10  When you activate the logical partition using this partition profile on the , the operating system sees four processors, because the logical partition is activated with the desired value of four virtual processors. Each of these virtual processors has 0.95 processing units supporting the work assigned to the processor. After the logical partition is activated, you can use dynamic partitioning to change the number of virtual processors on the logical partition to any between number 2 - 10, so long as the number of virtual processors is greater than the number of processing units that are assigned to the logical partition. If you increase the number of virtual processors, bear in mind that you will less processing power supporting the work assigned to each processor. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Memory resource assignment in partition profiles When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory resources that you want for the logical partition.  When you create a partition profile , the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory that you specify refer to physical memory in the system. If the desired amount of physical memory is available on the managed system when you activate the partition profile, the logical partition starts with the desired amount of physical memory. However, if the desired amount of physical memory is not available when you activate the partition profile, the physical memory on your managed system is over committed. In that case, if the amount of physical memory that is available on the managed system is equal to or greater than the minimum amount of physical memory in the partition profile, the logical partition starts with the available amount of physical memory. If the minimum amount of physical memory is not available, then the logical partition does not start. When you create a partition profile that is set to use shared memory, the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory that you specify refer to logical memory. When you activate the partition profile, the logical partition starts with the desired amount of logical memory. You can dynamically add and remove logical memory to and from a running logical partition within the minimum and maximum values set in the partition profile. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Memory Processors use memory to temporarily hold information. Memory requirements for logical partitions depend on the logical partition configuration, I/O resources assigned, and applications used. Memory can be assigned in increments of 16 MB, 32 MB, 64 MB, 128 MB, and 256 MB. The default memory block size varies according to the amount of configurable memory in the system.   Amount of configurable memory Default memory block size Less than 4 GB 16 MB Greater than 4 GB up to 8 GB 32 MB Greater than 8 GB up to 16 GB 64 MB Greater than 16 GB up to 32 GB 128 MB Greater than 32 GB 256 MB There are limits on how large a logical partition can grow based on the amount of memory initially allocated to it. Memory is added and removed to and from logical partitions in units of logical memory blocks. For logical partitions that are initially sized less than 256 MB, the maximum size to which a logical partition can grow is 16 times its initial size (up to the assigned maximum memory of the logical partition). For logical partitions that are initially sized 256 MB or larger, the maximum size to which the logical partition can grow is 64 times its initial size (up to the assigned maximum memory of the logical partition). The smallest increment for adding or removing memory to or from a logical partition is 16 MB. The memory block size can be changed by using the , or the Logical Memory Block Size option in the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI). The machine default value should only be changed under direction from your service provider. To change the memory block size, you must be a user with administrator authority, and you must shut down and restart the managed system for the change to take effect. If the minimum memory amount in any partition profile on the managed system is less than the new memory block size, you must also change the minimum memory amount in the partition profile. Each logical partition has a hardware page table (HPT).  The HPT ratio is the ratio of the HPT size to the maximum memory value for the logical partition. The HPT is allocated in the server firmware memory overhead for the logical partition, and the size of the HPT can affect the performance of the logical partition. The size of the HPT is determined by the following factors: The HPT ratio of 1/64 is the default value for all logical partitions. You can override the default value by using the  command-line interface to change the value in the partition profile. The maximum memory values that you establish for the logical partition  On systems that are managed by a , memory is assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. On systems that are managed by the , memory is assigned to logical partitions using the partition properties.  memory is physical system memory that you assign to a logical partition , and is reserved for use by the partition until you remove the memory from the partition or delete the partition. You can configure your system so that multiple logical partitions share a pool of physical memory. A shared memory environment includes the shared memory pool, logical partitions that use the shared memory in the shared memory pool, logical memory, I/O entitled memory, at least one  logical partition, and paging space devices. When you enable  for an  logical partition, you increase the memory capacity of the logical partition without assigning more memory to it. The operating system compresses a portion of the memory that the logical partition uses. This compression creates space for more data and expanding the memory capacity of the logical partition.

  memory  memory is physical system memory that you assign to a logical partition , and is reserved for use by the partition until you remove the memory from the partition or delete the partition. Depending on the overall memory in your system and the maximum memory values you choose for each logical partition, the server firmware must have enough memory to perform logical partition tasks. The amount of memory required by the server firmware varies according to several factors.  The following factors influence server firmware memory requirements: Number of partitions Partition environments of the partitions Number of physical and virtual I/O devices used by the partitions Maximum memory values given to the partitions  Firmware level updates can also change the server firmware memory requirements. Larger memory block sizes can exaggerate the memory requirement change. When selecting the maximum memory values for each  partition, consider the following points: Maximum values affect the hardware page table (HPT) size for each partition The logical memory map size for each partition If the server firmware detects that a memory module has failed or is about to fail, the server firmware creates a serviceable event. The server firmware can also unconfigure the failing memory module automatically, depending on the type of failure and the deconfiguration policies that you set up using the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI). You can also unconfigure a failing memory module manually using the ASMI. If a memory module failure causes the entire managed system to shut down, the managed system restarts automatically if the managed system is in normal IPL mode. When the managed system restarts itself, or when you restart the managed system manually, the managed system attempts to start the partitions that were running at the time of the memory module failure with their minimum memory values. If the managed system does not have enough memory to start all of the partitions with their minimum memory values, the managed system starts as many partitions as it can with their minimum memory values. If any memory is left over after the managed system has started as many partitions as it can, the managed system distributes the remaining memory resources to the running partitions in proportion to their wanted memory values.

 Setting huge-page memory values for  partitions Specify the number of 16 GB pages to allocate to an  huge-page memory pool. On managed systems that support huge-page memory, you can use the  () to set the value for the huge-page memory pool. You can also specify values for the number of huge pages to allocate to logical partitions. Using huge pages can improve performance in specific environments that require a high degree of parallelism, such as in DB2Â® database. You can specify huge-page memory that can be used for the shared-memory buffer pools in DB2. For logically partitioned systems, you can specify the minimum, wanted, and maximum number of huge pages to assign to a logical partition when you create the logical partition or partition profile.  To set the huge-page memory values, the system must be in the powered-off state. The new value takes effect when you restart the system.  Calculate the value for the number of pages to allocate to an  huge-page memory pool. View and set values for  huge-page memory allocation. Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Calculating huge-page memory requirements for  partitions Calculate the value for the number of pages to allocate to an  huge-page memory pool. To use huge-page memory, you must ensure that your system has adequate memory resources to dedicate to the huge-page memory pool. The huge-page memory pool is a region of system memory that is mapped as 16 GB page segments and is managed separately from the base memory of the system. Before you can specify the value for huge-page memory, you must determine which applications you are running and what the huge-page requirements are for your applications. Determining huge-page memory requirements for your application The huge-page memory pool can be used to enhance performance for DB2Â® in  operating systems. To determine this value, calculate the amount of memory required for the shared buffer pool to support your DB2 applications. Refer to the DB2 recommendations for buffer pool memory for your particular application.  The huge page memory allocation cannot be changed dynamically. When you change the number of huge pages on the server requires that you reboot the server. Changing the number of assigned huge pages for a logical partition requires that you restart the logical partition. Considerations for calculating the huge-page values The amount of huge-page memory that you can allocate is dependent on the following factors:Total amount of licensed memory for your server Amount of available memory after configured memory resources are accounted for Number of physical IO connections to the server (each IO connection requires memory for the IO tables, which can be distributed among the physical memory regions and reduces the memory available for huge pages) Base memory configuration for logical partitions (huge pages are not calculated as part of the configured-partition memory allocation) The requirements that define a huge page, that is each huge page requires 16 GB of contiguous real memory and must start on a 16 GB memory boundary Huge pages cannot span processing units. Each processing unit requires 32 GB to ensure at least one 16 GB huge page when all of the other considerations previously listed are taken into account.  The server firmware reduces the huge-page pool size to satisfy some of these dependencies.  When this occurs, error log entries are generated to indicate that the huge-page pool size was reduced.  The error log reference code is B700 5300.  The reference code details  indicates hexadecimal values that indicate why the huge-page pool size could not be satisfied.  The following example shows the possible entries and how to interpret the additional words in these entries:word 3 = 0x0000000100000106: This means that the huge-page pool was reduced to satisfy the system hardware configuration word 4 = number of user-configured huge pages word 5 = number of huge pages that could be provided word 3 = 0x0000000100000105: This means that the huge-page pool was reduced to satisfy the memory configuration of logical partitionsword 4 = number of huge pages before logical partitions were created word 5 = firmware calculated number of huge pages after satisfying logical partition memory requirements word 6 = number of huge pages in the pool Calculating huge-page memory values To calculate the server memory requirements to support huge pages, use the following steps: Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Viewing and setting huge-page memory values for  partitions View and set values for  huge-page memory allocation. On systems that support huge-page (16 GB) memory allocation, you can set the current value in the huge-page memory table. On a new system, you must set this value initially to establish the huge-page memory pool. You must set the value when the managed system is in the powered-off state. If this value is already set, you must change the value to adjust for performance needs based on the applications that you are running and your logical partition configurations. You can also change the values set for the number of huge pages allocated to your logical partitions.  Use this task to set or adjust the number of 16 GB pages for the huge-page allocation according to your needs.  To change the values for logical partitions, you must shut down the logical partition. The new value takes effect when you restart the logical partition. To set huge-page memory values for a logical partition, do the following: Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Shared memory You can configure your system so that multiple logical partitions share a pool of physical memory. A shared memory environment includes the shared memory pool, logical partitions that use the shared memory in the shared memory pool, logical memory, I/O entitled memory, at least one  logical partition, and paging space devices. Shared memory is physical memory that is assigned to the shared memory pool and shared among multiple logical partitions. The shared memory pool is a defined collection of physical memory blocks that are managed as a single memory pool by the hypervisor. Logical partitions that you configure to use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) share the memory in the pool with other shared memory partitions. When the operating system that runs in a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) needs to access data, the data must reside in the shared memory pool. Systems with overcommitted memory configurations require the hypervisor and at least one  (VIOS) logical partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partition) to move data between the shared memory pool and the paging space devices as needed. Logical memory is the address space, assigned to a logical partition, that the operating system perceives as its main storage. For a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition), a subset of the logical memory is backed up by physical main storage and the remaining logical memory is kept in auxiliary storage. I/O entitled memory is the maximum amount of physical memory (from the shared memory pool) that is guaranteed to be available to a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) for its I/O devices at any given time. A  (VIOS) logical partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) provides access to the paging space devices for the logical partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions). You can learn about how the  () and  allocate and manipulate paging space devices on systems that use shared memory. The hypervisor uses the memory weight of each logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) to help determine which logical partitions receive more physical memory from the shared memory pool. To help optimize performance and memory use, the operating systems that run in shared memory partitions provide the hypervisor with information about how the operating system uses its memory to help the hypervisor determine which pages to store in the shared memory pool and which pages to store in the paging space devices.

 Overview of shared memory Shared memory is physical memory that is assigned to the shared memory pool and shared among multiple logical partitions. The shared memory pool is a defined collection of physical memory blocks that are managed as a single memory pool by the hypervisor. Logical partitions that you configure to use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) share the memory in the pool with other shared memory partitions.  For example, you create a shared memory pool with 16 GB of physical memory. You then create three logical partitions, configure them to use shared memory, and activate the shared memory partitions. Each shared memory partition can use the 16 GB that are in the shared memory pool.  The hypervisor determines the amount of memory allocated from the shared memory pool to each shared memory partition based on the workload and memory configuration of each shared memory partition. When allocating the physical memory to the shared memory partitions, the hypervisor ensures that each shared memory partition can access only the memory allocated to the shared memory partition at any given time. A shared memory partition cannot access the physical memory allocated to another shared memory partition. The amount of memory that you assign to the shared memory partitions can be greater than the amount of memory in the shared memory pool. For example, you can assign 12 GB to shared memory partition 1, 8 GB to shared memory partition 2, and 4 GB to shared memory partition 3. Together, the shared memory partitions use 24 GB of memory, but the shared memory pool has only 16 GB of memory. In this situation, the memory configuration is considered overcommitted. Overcommitted memory configurations are possible because the hypervisor virtualizes and manages all of the memory for the shared memory partitions in the shared memory pool as follows: When shared memory partitions are not actively using their memory pages, the hypervisor allocates those unused memory pages to shared memory partitions that currently need them.  The hypervisor does not need to store any data in auxiliary storage. When a shared memory partition requires more memory than the hypervisor can provide to it by allocating unused portions of the shared memory pool, the hypervisor stores some of the memory that belongs to a shared memory partition in the shared memory pool and stores the remainder of the memory that belongs to the shared memory partition in auxiliary storage.  When the operating system attempts to access the data, the hypervisor might need to retrieve the data from auxiliary storage before the operating system can access it.  Because the memory that you assign to a shared memory partition might not always reside in the shared memory pool, the memory that you assign to a shared memory partition is logical memory. Logical memory is the address space, assigned to a logical partition, that the operating system perceives as its main storage. For a shared memory partition, a subset of the logical memory is backed up by physical main storage (or physical memory from the shared memory pool) and the remaining logical memory is kept in auxiliary storage. A  logical partition provides access to the auxiliary storage, or paging space devices, required for shared memory partitions in an overcommitted memory configuration. A paging space device is a physical or logical device that is used by a  to provide the paging space for a shared memory partition. The paging space is an area of nonvolatile storage used to hold portions of a shared memory partition's logical memory that do not reside in the shared memory pool. When the operating system that runs in a shared memory partition attempts to access data, and the data is located in the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition, the hypervisor sends a request to a  to retrieve the data and write it to the shared memory pool so that the operating system can access it.  On systems that are managed by a  (), you can assign up to two  (VIOS) logical partitions to the shared memory pool at a time (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions). When you assign two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool, you can configure the paging space devices such that both paging VIOS partitions have access to the same paging space devices. When one paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable, the hypervisor sends a request to the other paging VIOS partition to retrieve the data on the paging space device.  You cannot configure paging VIOS partitions to use shared memory. Paging VIOS partitions do not use the memory in the shared memory pool. You assign paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool so that they can provide access to the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool. Driven by workload demands from the shared memory partitions, the hypervisor manages overcommitted memory configurations by continually performing the following tasks: Allocating portions of physical memory from the shared memory pool to the shared memory partitions as needed Requesting a paging VIOS partition to read and write data between the shared memory pool and the paging space devices as needed The ability to share memory among multiple logical partitions is known as the  technology. The  technology is available with the  for which you must obtain and enter a  activation code.  Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks: Related information:         
 Example: A shared memory configuration that is logically overcommitted The following figure shows a server with shared memory configuration that is logically overcommitted. The figure shows a shared memory pool of 16.25 GB that is shared among three shared memory partitions. The hypervisor uses a small portion (0.25 GB) of the shared memory pool to manage the shared memory resources. The figure also shows one paging VIOS partition that owns all of the physical storage in the system. The physical storage contains a paging space device for each shared memory partition. The paging VIOS partition does not use the memory in the shared memory pool, but rather receives dedicated memory of 1 GB. Of the remaining system memory, 1 GB is reserved for the hypervisor so that it can manage other system resources, and 13.75 GB is free memory that is available for system growth. For example, you can dynamically add more memory to the shared memory pool or you can create additional dedicated memory partitions. Shared memory partition 1 is assigned 12 GB of logical memory, Shared memory partition 2 is assigned 8 GB of logical memory, and Shared memory partition 3 is assigned 4 GB of logical memory. Together, the shared memory partitions are assigned 24 GB of logical memory, which is more than the 16.25 GB allocated to the shared memory pool. Therefore, the memory configuration is overcommitted. Shared memory partition 1 currently uses 8 GB of physical memory, Shared memory partition 2 currently uses 4 GB of physical memory, and Shared memory partition 3 currently uses 4 GB of physical memory. Together, the shared memory partitions currently use 16 GB of physical memory, which is equal to the amount of physical memory available to them in the shared memory pool. Therefore, the memory configuration is logically overcommitted. In other words, the shared memory pool contains enough physical memory for the hypervisor to allocate unused memory pages to shared memory partitions that need them. All of the memory currently used by the shared memory partitions resides in the shared memory pool. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Performance considerations for overcommitted shared memory partitions Learn about how the degree to which the memory configuration of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) is overcommitted affects the performance of the shared memory partition. In general, the less overcommitted the memory configuration of a shared memory partition, the better its performance. A shared memory configuration is considered overcommitted when the sum of the logical memory that is assigned to all of the shared memory partitions is greater than the amount of physical memory in the shared memory pool.      The figure shows a shared memory partition that is currently allocated 0.8 GB of physical memory and assigned 2.5 GB of logical memory. If the workload that runs in the shared memory partition currently uses 0.8 GB of memory and requires an additional 1.5 GB of memory, and the shared memory pool is physically overcommitted, the hypervisor stores 1.5 GB of the shared memory partition's memory in its paging space device. When the shared memory partition needs to access data on the paging space device, the hypervisor directs a paging VIOS partition to read the data from the paging space device and write the data to the shared memory pool. The more memory that the hypervisor must store on the paging space device, the more often the hypervisor and paging VIOS partition need to read and write data between the paging space device and the shared memory pool. Compared to directly accessing data that is stored in the shared memory pool, it takes more time to access data that is stored in the paging space device. Thus, in general, the less overcommitted the memory configuration of a shared memory partition, the better its performance. The operating systems that run in the shared memory partitions help improve the performance of the shared memory partitions with overcommitted memory configurations by providing the hypervisor with information about how the operating system uses the physical memory allocated to it. Using this information, the hypervisor can store data that the operating system accesses the least often in the paging space device and store the data that the operating system accesses the most often in the shared memory pool. This reduces the frequency that the hypervisor needs to access the paging space device and increases the performance of the shared memory partition.

 Performance considerations for shared memory partitions You can learn about performance factors (such as shared memory overcommitment) that influence the performance of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition). You can also use shared memory statistics to help you determine how to adjust the configuration of a shared memory partition to improve its performance. Learn about how the degree to which the memory configuration of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) is overcommitted affects the performance of the shared memory partition. In general, the less overcommitted the memory configuration of a shared memory partition, the better its performance. In addition to overcommitment considerations, you need to consider other factors that can affect the performance of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition). These factors include the workload running in the shared memory partition, the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition, whether the operating system or applications that run in the shared memory partition use memory affinity. The  (), , and  environments provide statistics about the shared memory configuration. Parent topic:          
 Factors that influence the performance of shared memory partitions In addition to overcommitment considerations, you need to consider other factors that can affect the performance of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition). These factors include the workload running in the shared memory partition, the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition, whether the operating system or applications that run in the shared memory partition use memory affinity. The following table describes the types of workloads that are appropriate to run in shared memory configurations that are logically and physically overcommitted. It also describes the types of workloads that are not appropriate to run in a shared memory configuration. Workloads for logically overcommitted configurations Workloads for physically overcommitted configurations Workloads for dedicated memory configurations Workloads that peak at opposite and varying times. Workloads with memory residency requirements that have a low average. Workloads that do not have a sustained load. Logical partitions that serve as failover and backup logical partitions when configured on the same server as their primary counterparts. Test and development environments. Workloads that run the  operating system and use the file cache. Print servers, file servers, network applications, and other workloads that are less sensitive to I/O latency. Workloads that are inactive most of the time. Workloads with high quality of service criteria. Workloads that consistently consume memory resources due to sustained peak load. High performance computing (HPC) workloads. In addition to the degree to which the memory configuration of a shared memory partition is overcommitted, the following factors can influence the performance of a shared memory partition: The workload that runs in a shared memory partition, the number of virtual adapters that are assigned to the shared memory partition, and the I/O entitled memory set for the shared memory partition all directly affect the performance of I/O devices. These factors can cause I/O devices to operate at their minimum memory requirements rather than their optimal memory requirements. This can cause delays in I/O operations. The amount of I/O entitled memory required for optimal performance depends on the workload and number of adapters configured.  The operating systems that run in shared memory partitions cannot use memory affinity. Some applications rely on memory affinity to improve their performance.  The shared memory partition might be suspended if it attempts to access data on its paging space device when the following situations occur simultaneously:The paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable. For example, you shut down the paging VIOS partition or the paging VIOS partition fails. The shared memory partition is not configured to use redundant paging VIOS partitions to access its paging space device. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related reference:         
 Paging VIOS partition A  (VIOS) logical partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) provides access to the paging space devices for the logical partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions).  When the operating system that runs in a shared memory partition attempts to access data, and the data is located in the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition, the hypervisor sends a request to a paging VIOS partition to retrieve the data and write it to the shared memory pool so that the operating system can access it. A paging VIOS partition is not a shared memory partition and does not use the memory in the shared memory pool. A paging VIOS partition provides access to the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions. On systems that are managed by the , the management partition is the paging VIOS partition for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool. When you create the shared memory pool, you assign a paging storage pool to the shared memory pool. The paging storage pool provides the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool. On systems that are managed by a  (), you can assign one or two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool. When you assign a single paging VIOS partition to the shared memory pool, the paging VIOS partition provides access to all of the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions. The paging space devices can be located in physical storage in the server or on a storage area network (SAN). When you assign two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool, you can configure each paging VIOS partition to access paging space devices in one of the following ways:You can configure each paging VIOS partition to access independent paging space devices. Paging space devices that are accessed by only one paging VIOS partition, or independent paging space devices, can be located in physical storage in the server or on a SAN. You can configure both paging VIOS partitions to access the same, or common, paging space devices. In this configuration, the paging VIOS partitions provide redundant access to paging space devices. When one paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable, the hypervisor sends a request to the other paging VIOS partition to retrieve the data on the paging space device. Common paging space devices must be located on a SAN to enable symmetrical access from both paging VIOS partitions. You can configure each paging VIOS partition to access some independent paging space devices and some common paging space devices. If you configure the shared memory pool with two paging VIOS partitions, you can configure a shared memory partition to use either a single paging VIOS partition or redundant paging VIOS partitions. When you configure a shared memory partition to use redundant paging VIOS partitions, you assign a primary paging VIOS partition and a secondary paging VIOS partition to the shared memory partition. The hypervisor uses the primary paging VIOS partition to access the shared memory partition's paging space device. At this point, the primary paging VIOS partition is the current paging VIOS partition for the shared memory partition. The current paging VIOS partition is the paging VIOS partition that the hypervisor uses at any point in time to access data in the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the primary paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable, the hypervisor uses the secondary paging VIOS partition to access the shared memory partition's paging space device. At this point, the secondary paging VIOS partition becomes the current paging VIOS partition for the shared memory partition and continues as the current paging VIOS partition even after the primary paging VIOS partition becomes available again.  You do not need to assign the same primary and secondary paging VIOS partitions to all of the shared memory partitions. For example, you assign paging VIOS partition A and paging VIOS partition B to the shared memory pool. For one shared memory partition, you can assign paging VIOS partition A as the primary paging VIOS partition and paging VIOS partition B as the secondary paging VIOS partition. For a different shared memory partition, you can assign paging VIOS partition B as the primary paging VIOS partition and paging VIOS partition A as the secondary paging VIOS partition.  The following figure shows an example of a system with four shared memory partitions, two paging VIOS partitions, and four paging space devices. The example shows the configuration options for paging VIOS partitions and paging space devices as described in the following table. Configuration option Example The paging space device that is assigned to a shared memory partition is located in physical storage in the server and is accessed by a single paging VIOS partition. Paging space device 4 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 4. Shared memory partition 4 is assigned to use Paging VIOS partition 2 to access Paging space device 4. Paging space device 4 is located in physical storage in the server and is assigned to Paging VIOS partition 2. Paging VIOS partition 2 is the only paging VIOS partition that can access Paging space device 4 (This relationship is shown by the blue line that connects Paging VIOS partition 2 to Paging space device 4.). The paging space device that is assigned to a shared memory partition is located on a SAN and is accessed by a single paging VIOS partition. Paging space device 1 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 1. Shared memory partition 1 is assigned to use Paging VIOS partition 1 to access Paging space device 1. Paging space device 1 is connected to the SAN. Paging VIOS partition 1 is also connected to the SAN and is the only paging VIOS partition that can access Paging space device 1 (This relationship is shown by the green line that connects Paging VIOS partition 1 to Paging space device 1.). The paging space device that is assigned to a shared memory partition is located on a SAN and is accessed redundantly by two paging VIOS partitions. Paging space device 2 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 2. Paging space device 2 is connected to the SAN. Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2 are also connected to the SAN and can both access Paging space device 2. (These relationships are shown by the green line that connects Paging VIOS partition 1 to Paging space device 2 and the blue line that connects Paging VIOS partition 2 to Paging space device 2.) Shared memory partition 2 is assigned to use redundant paging VIOS partitions to access Paging space device 2. Paging VIOS partition 1 is configured as the primary paging VIOS partition and Paging VIOS partition 2 is configured as the secondary paging VIOS partition. Similarly, Paging space device 3 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 3. Paging space device 3 is connected to the SAN. Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2 are also connected to the SAN and can both access Paging space device 3. (These relationships are shown by the green line that connects Paging VIOS partition 1 to Paging space device 3 and the blue line that connects Paging VIOS partition 2 to Paging space device 3.) Shared memory partition 3 is assigned to use redundant paging VIOS partitions to access Paging space device 3. Paging VIOS partition 2 is configured as the primary paging VIOS partition and Paging VIOS partition 1 is configured as the secondary paging VIOS partition. Because Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2 both have access to Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3, Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3 are common paging space devices that are accessed redundantly by Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2. If Paging VIOS partition 1 becomes unavailable and Shared memory partition 2 needs to access data on its paging space device, the hypervisor sends a request to Paging VIOS partition 2 to retrieve the data on Paging space device 2. Similarly, if Paging VIOS partition 2 becomes unavailable and Shared memory partition 3 needs to access the data on its paging space device, the hypervisor sends a request to Paging VIOS partition 1 to retrieve the data on Paging space device 3. A paging VIOS partition accesses both independent and common paging space devices. Paging space device 1 and Paging space device 4 are independent paging space devices because only one paging VIOS partition accesses each. Paging VIOS partition 1 accesses Paging space device 1, and Paging VIOS partition 2 accesses Paging space device 4. Paging space device 2 and paging space device 3 are common paging space devices because both paging VIOS partitions access each. (These relationships are shown by the green and blue lines that connect the paging VIOS partitions to the paging space devices.)Paging VIOS partition 1 accesses the independent paging space device Paging space device 1, and also accesses the common paging space devices Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3. Paging VIOS partition 2 accesses the independent paging space device Paging space device 4 and also accesses the common paging space devices Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3.  When a single paging VIOS partition is assigned to the shared memory pool, you must shut down the shared memory partitions before you shut down the paging VIOS partition so that the shared memory partitions are not suspended when they attempt to access their paging space devices. When two paging VIOS partitions are assigned to the shared memory pool and the shared memory partitions are configured to use redundant paging VIOS partitions, you do not need to shut down the shared memory partitions to shut down a paging VIOS partition. When one paging VIOS partition is shut down, the shared memory partitions use the other paging VIOS partition to access their paging space devices. For example, you can shut down a paging VIOS partition and install VIOS updates without shutting down the shared memory partitions. You can configure multiple VIOS logical partitions to provide access to paging space devices. However, you can only assign up to two of those VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool at any given time. After you configure the shared memory partitions, you can later change the redundancy configuration of the paging VIOS partitions for a shared memory partition by modifying the partition profile of the shared memory partition and restarting the shared memory partition with the modified partition profile: You can change which paging VIOS partitions are assigned to a shared memory partition as the primary and secondary paging VIOS partitions.  You can change the number of paging VIOS partitions that are assigned to a shared memory partition. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks: Related reference:

The  automatically creates a paging space device for the shared memory partition in one or more of the following situations: No paging space devices exist in the paging storage pool.

 Preparing to configure shared memory Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to plan for the shared memory pool, the shared memory partitions, the paging space devices, and the  logical partitions (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions).  Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to determine the size of the shared memory pool, the number of shared memory partitions to assign to the shared memory pool, and the amount of memory to assign to each shared memory partition.

 Preparing to configure shared memory on a system that is managed by the  Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to determine the size of the shared memory pool, the number of shared memory partitions to assign to the shared memory pool, and the amount of memory to assign to each shared memory partition. Before you start, verify that your system meets the requirements for configuring shared memory. For instructions, see . To prepare to configure the shared memory pool and shared memory partitions, complete the following steps:    You can apply the same general guidelines that you might use to assign the desired, minimum, and maximum dedicated memory to logical partitions that use dedicated memory. For example: Do not assign the maximum logical memory to a value that is higher than the amount of logical memory that you plan to dynamically add to the shared memory partition. Set the minimum logical memory to a value that is high enough for the shared memory partition to successfully activate.  For instructions, see .  The paging storage pool can contain paging space devices and virtual disks. However, you cannot use the same logical volume as both a paging space device and as a virtual disk at the same time. Consider reserving an entire storage pool for paging space devices. Optional:  If you do not assign paging space devices to the shared memory pool,  automatically creates them for you from the paging storage pool when you create the shared memory partitions. If you decide to manually create the paging space devices, consider the following requirements:You need to assign a minimum of one paging space device to the shared memory pool for each shared memory partition. For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition that you identified in step 1b.  For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition that you identified in step 1b multiplied by 129/128. For example, you plan to create an  shared memory partition with a maximum logical memory size of 16 GB. The paging space device must be at least 16.125 GB. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Configuration requirements for shared memory Review the requirements for the system,  (VIOS), logical partitions, and paging space devices so that you can successfully configure shared memory. System requirementsThe server must be a  processor-based server. The server firmware must be at release 3.4.2, or later. The  () must be at version 7 release 3.4.2, or later. The  must be at version 2.1.1, or later. The  technology must be activated. The  technology is available with the  for which you must obtain and enter a  activation code.  Paging VIOS partition requirementsVIOS partitions that provide access to the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions) cannot use shared memory. Paging VIOS partitions must use dedicated memory.  Paging VIOS partitions must be at version 2.1.1, or later. On IVM-managed systems, all logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) must use virtual resources provided by the management partition. On -managed systems, consider configuring separate VIOS partitions as server partitions and paging VIOS partitions. For example, configure one VIOS partition to provide virtual resources to the shared memory partitions. Then, configure another VIOS partition as a paging VIOS partition. On -managed systems, you can configure multiple VIOS partitions to provide access to paging space devices. However, you can only assign up to two of those VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool at any given time. Requirements for shared memory partitionsShared memory partitions must use shared processors.  You can assign only virtual adapters to shared memory partitions. This means that you can dynamically add only virtual adapters to shared memory partitions. More specifically, the following table lists the virtual adapters that you can assign shared memory partitions.  and  shared memory partitions  shared memory partitions Virtual SCSI client adapters Virtual Ethernet adapters Virtual fibre channel client adapters Virtual serial adapters Virtual SCSI client adapters Virtual Ethernet adapters Virtual fibre channel client adapters Virtual serial server adapters  shared memory partitions Virtual SCSI client adapters Virtual Ethernet adapters Virtual fibre channel client adapters Virtual serial adapters You cannot assign s (HEA) or host connection adapters (HCA) to shared memory partitions. Shared memory partitions cannot use the barrier synchronization register. Shared memory partitions cannot use huge pages.  must be at version 6.1 Technology Level 3, or later, to run in a shared memory partition.  must be at 6.1 with PTF SI32798, to run in a shared memory partition. Virtual OptiConnect must not be enabled on  shared memory partitions.  must be at version 11, or later, to run in a shared memory partition.  Enterprise Server Version 6, or later, to run in a shared memory partition  Logical partitions that provide virtual resources to other logical partitions in a shared memory environment must be VIOS partitions.  Requirements for paging space devicesThe paging space devices for  shared memory partitions must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory of the shared memory partition. The paging space devices for  shared memory partitions must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory of the shared memory partition plus 8 KB for every megabyte. For example, if the maximum logical memory of the shared memory partition is 16 GB, its paging space device must be at least 16.125 GB.  Paging space devices can only be assigned to one shared memory pool at a time. You cannot assign the same paging space device to a shared memory pool on one system and to another shared memory pool on another system at the same time. Paging space devices that are accessed by a single paging VIOS partition must meet the following requirements:They can be physical or logical volumes. They can be located in physical storage on the server or on a storage area network (SAN). Paging space devices that are accessed redundantly by two paging VIOS partitions must meet the following requirements: They must be physical volumes. They must be located on a SAN. They must be configured with global IDs. They must be accessible to both paging VIOS partitions. The reserve attribute must be set to no reserve. (The VIOS automatically sets the reserve attribute to no reserve when you add the paging space device to the shared memory pool.) Physical volumes that are configured as paging space devices cannot belong to a volume group, such as the  volume group.  Logical volumes that are configured as paging space devices must be located in a volume group that is dedicated for paging space devices. Paging space devices must be available. You cannot use the physical volume or logical volume as a paging space device if it is already configured as a paging space device or virtual disk for another logical partition. Paging space devices cannot be used to boot a logical partition. After you assign a paging space device to the shared memory pool, you must manage the device by using one of the following tools: The Create/Modify Shared Memory Pool wizard on the .  The View/Modify Shared Memory Pool page on the .  Do not change or remove the device using other management tools. On logical partitions with the Suspend/Resume feature, paging space devices are used to save suspension data for logical partitions that are configured to use shared memory. The paging space device size must be a minimum of 110% of the maximum memory of the logical partition. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks:         
 Paging space devices on systems that are managed by an  Learn about the location requirements, size requirements for paging space devices on systems that are managed by a  (). When you configure the shared memory pool, you assign paging space devices to the shared memory pool. Paging space devices can be located in physical storage in the server or on a storage area network (SAN) as follows: Paging space devices that are accessed by a single  (VIOS) logical partition (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) can be located in physical storage in the server or on a SAN. Paging space devices that are accessed redundantly by two paging VIOS partitions, or common paging space devices, must be located on a SAN. When you activate a shared memory partition, the  allocates a paging space device (that is assigned to the shared memory pool) to the shared memory partition. The  allocates only one paging space device to a shared memory partition at a time. When you shut down a shared memory partition, its paging space device becomes available to the  to allocate elsewhere. Thus, the fewest number of paging space devices that must be assigned to the shared memory pool is equal to the number of shared memory partitions that you plan to run simultaneously. After you create the shared memory pool, you can add or remove paging space devices to or from the shared memory pool as needed.  The  assigns paging space devices to shared memory partitions based on the size requirements for the shared memory partition and the redundancy preferences that you specify for partition activation. Size requirementsThe  allocates a paging space device to a shared memory partition that best fits the size requirements of the shared memory partition. For  and  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition.  For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition plus 8 KB for every megabyte.  Shared memory partitions might have several partition profiles that specify different maximum logical memory sizes. To maintain flexibility, consider creating paging space devices that are large enough to be used by shared memory partitions with multiple partition profiles. When you activate a shared memory partition with a different partition profile, the shared memory partition already has a paging space device allocated to it based on the size requirements of the previously activated partition profile. If you create a paging space device that is large enough to meet the size requirements of multiple partition profiles and you activate the shared memory partition with a different partition profile, the  can use the same paging space device for the newly activated partition profile. If the paging space device does not meet the size requirements of the newly activated partition profile, the  frees the paging space device currently allocated to the shared memory partition and allocates a different paging space device that meets the size requirements specified in the newly activated partition profile.  Redundancy preferencesThe  allocates a paging space device to a shared memory partition that satisfies the redundancy preferences that you specify for partition activation: If you specify that the shared memory partition uses redundant paging VIOS partitions, the  uses the following process to select a suitable paging space device for the shared memory partition:The  assigns a paging space device that is common and available. (A paging space device is available when it is not currently assigned to a shared memory partition and is inactive.) If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and available, it reassigns a paging space device that is common and unavailable. (A paging space device is unavailable when it is active and currently assigned to a shared memory partition that is shut down.) If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and unavailable, it cannot activate the shared memory partition. If you specify that the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions, the  uses the following process to select a suitable paging space device for the shared memory partition: The  assigns a paging space device that is independent and available. (A paging space device is independent when it is accessed by only one paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition.) If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and available, the  reassigns a paging space device that is independent and unavailable. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and unavailable, and two paging VIOS partitions are assigned to the shared memory pool, then the  assigns a paging space device that is common and available.  If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and available, and two paging VIOS partitions are assigned to the shared memory pool, then the  reassigns a paging space device that is common and unavailable.  If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and unavailable, it cannot activate the shared memory partition. If you specify that the shared memory partition use redundant paging VIOS partitions, if possible, the  uses the following process to select a suitable paging space device for the shared memory partition:The  assigns a paging space device that is common and available. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and available, it assigns a paging space device that is common and unavailable. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and unavailable, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and available to the primary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the primary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and available to the primary paging VIOS partition, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and unavailable to the primary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the primary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and unavailable to the primary paging VIOS partition, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and available to the secondary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the secondary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and available to the secondary paging VIOS partition, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and unavailable to the secondary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the secondary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition.

To add and remove paging space devices, complete the following steps from the :  The Shared Memory Pool wizard is displayed.   Paging space devices can only be assigned to one shared memory pool at a time. You cannot assign the same paging space device to a shared memory pool on one system and to another shared memory pool on another system at the same time.   If you expect to see a particular device on the list of eligible devices to add to the shared memory pool, but the device does not appear, you can run the  command from the  command line. You can run the  command to determine why the device does not meet the requirements for paging space devices and to learn what tasks need to be performed on the device to satisfy the requirements. If a device was used by a logical partition and then the logical partition was removed, the device might not meet the requirements for a paging space device, even though the logical partition was removed. The  command detects this situation and provides instructions about how to change the device so that it meets the requirements for a paging space device. Parent topic:  Related concepts:

 Changing virtual Fibre Channel for a  using the  You can use the  () to dynamically manage virtual Fibre Channel on your managed system and the partition connections for the associated physical Fibre Channel ports. Assigning one or more physical ports to a logical partition enables the partition to communicate with storage devices in a storage area network (SAN). Configuring this type of storage resource is available only when the system supports the use of virtual Fibre Channel adapters and has a physical Fibre Channel adapter installed and connected that supports N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) ports. To assign the virtual Fibre Channel adapter to a physical port, ensure that the client logical partition owns one or more virtual Fibre Channel adapters and that the  owns corresponding virtual Fibre Channel adapters to host the client adapter. To change a port connection assignment for a logical partition, the partition must be either in the  or the  state. If the partition is in the  state, the partition must also be capable of dynamic partitioning (DLPAR). To avoid configuring the physical Fibre Channel adapter to be a single point of failure for the connection between the client logical partition and its physical storage on the SAN, do not connect two virtual Fibre Channel adapters from the same client logical partition to the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. Instead, connect each virtual Fibre Channel adapter to a different physical Fibre Channel adapter. To change virtual Fibre Channel, be sure you meet the following requirements:The  must be at version 7 release 3.4.2 or later. The  must be at version 2.1.1.0 or later. Ensure that there is a resource monitoring and control connection between the  and the . To configure the physical port connections for virtual Fibre Channel, complete the following steps in the :  The Modify Virtual Fibre Channel Partition Assignment page is displayed.

 Managing logical partitions You can manage the configuration of your logical partitions using the  (). The  allows you to adjust the hardware resources that are used by each logical partition. You can activate many logical partitions at a time by using the  () to activate a system profile. A system profile is an ordered list of partition profiles. When you activate a system profile, the managed system attempts to activate the partition profiles in the system profile in the order in which the partition profiles are listed. You can shut down and restart logical partitions running on systems that are managed by a  (). You can manage the partition profiles for your logical partitions using the  (). You can change the resource specifications stored in your partition profiles as your needs change. You can manage the system profiles on your managed system using the  (). You can change the logical partitions and partition profiles specified within the system profiles as the logical partitions change on your managed system. You use the  () to add, remove, or move processor, memory, and I/O resources between running logical partitions without restarting the logical partitions or the managed system.  Use the  () to manage virtual storage that is associated with  logical partitions. You can use the  () to change the memory configuration of a logical partition. For example, you can  change the memory mode of a logical partition, and dynamically add and remove dedicated or shared memory to and from a logical partition. When all of the worldwide port names (WWPNs) on the server are used, you can add more WWPNs to the server using the  (). Adding WWPNs allows you to create additional virtual Fibre Channel adapters on client logical partitions that use virtual resources provided by the . To avoid shutting down mission-critical workloads when your server firmware deconfigures a failing processor, you can use the  () to set partition-availablity priorities for the logical partitions on your managed system. A logical partition with a failing processor can acquire a replacement processor from logical partitions with a lower partition-availability priority. The acquisition of a replacement processor allows the logical partition with the higher partition-availability priority to continue running after a processor failure. It is crucial that you back up your data because you never know when you might need to do a server recovery. Save everything in your system as often as possible. You might not be prepared to recover from a site loss or certain types of disk failures if you do not regularly save everything. You can manage logical partitions that use  virtual I/O resources to help maximize utilization of the physical hardware and simplify the backup procedure for your managed system.

 Activating a logical partition You can use the  () to activate a logical partition based on its current configuration instead of a partition profile. When you activate the logical partition, the system commits resources to the logical partition based on the current configuration of the logical partition and starts the operating system or software that is installed on the logical partition. Logical partitions start faster when activated based on their current configuration data than when activated with a partition profile. You can view the resource configuration status of a logical partition by using the  ().  On a  () that is at Version 7 Release 7.8.0, or later, you can apply a profile to a logical partition without powering on the logical partition by using the  command-line interface.  Parent topic:          
 Activating a partition profile  A partition profile is a record on the  that specifies a possible configuration for a logical partition. If you plan to activate a logical partition that uses virtual resources provided by the , you must first activate the  () logical partition that provides the virtual resources. If you plan to activate a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition), you must first activate at least one  logical partition that meets the following criteria: The  logical partition (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) must provide access to an available paging space device that meets the size requirements of the shared memory partition. The paging VIOS partition must be assigned to the shared memory pool. If the shared memory partition is configured with redundant paging  partitions, activate both paging  partitions before you activate the shared memory partition. When you activate a shared memory partition and the shared memory pool does not contain enough physical memory required for activation, you can release to the hypervisor the physical memory that is currently assigned to other shared memory partitions that are shut down. The hypervisor can then assign the released physical memory to the shared memory partition that you want to activate.

 Power-on self-test keys The power-on self-test (POST) keys can start services or initiate service mode boots used for configuring the system and diagnosing problems. After power is turned on and before the operating system is loaded, the system does a power-on self-test (POST). This test performs checks to ensure that the hardware is functioning correctly before the operating system is loaded. During the POST, a POST screen is displayed, and POST indicators appear on the firmware console (if one is connected). The POST keys, if pressed after the keyboard POST indicator is displayed and before the last POST indicator speaker is displayed, cause the system to start services or to initiate service mode boots used for configuring the system and diagnosing problems.  The program function keys (F1-F12) on a keyboard attached to the service processor are not used and are ignored. After the keyboard POST indicator is displayed, you must use the numeric number keys. The numeric 1 key, when pressed during POST, starts the system management services interface. The numeric 5 key, when pressed during POST, initiates a system boot in service mode using the default service mode boot list. This mode attempts to boot from the first device of each type found in the list. It does not search for other bootable devices of that type if the first device is not bootable. Instead, it continues to the next device type in the list.   The default boot sequence is:  Diskette (if installed) CD-ROM (if installed) Tape drive (if installed) Hard file Network  The numeric 6 key works like the numeric 5 key. Parent topic:     |

 cfgdev command Purpose Configures devices in the .   Syntax cfgdev [  Name ]   Description The cfgdev command configures devices. If there are any devices detected that have no device software installed when configuring devices, the cfgdev command returns a warning message with the name or a list of possible names for the device package that must be installed. If the specific name of the device package is determined, it is displayed as the only package name, on a line below the warning message. If the specific name cannot be determined, a colon-separated list of possible package names is displayed on a single line. A package name or list of possible package names is displayed for each of the devices, if more than one device is detected without its device software.  The system displays the following warning message when devices without their device software are detected: cfgdev: 0514-621 WARNING: The following device packages are         required for device support but are not currently          installed. devices.pci.22100020 devices.pci.14101800 devices.pci.scsi:devices.pci.00100300:devices.pci.NCR.53C825  In this example, two devices were found that had missing software, and the cfgdev command displayed the names of the device packages that must be installed. A third device that also has missing software was found, but in this case, the cfgdev command displays several possible device package names.   To protect the Configuration database, the cfgdev command is not interruptible. Stopping this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.   Flags Flag name Description -dev Name Specifies the named device to configure along with its children.   Exit Status See .

 chdev command Purpose Changes the characteristics of a device.   Syntax chdev   Name [ ]  Attribute=Value... [] [] chdev  Udid [ ]  Attribute=Value... [] []   Description The chdev command changes the characteristics of the device specified with the given device logical name (the -dev Name flag).  Some changes may not be allowed when the device is in the Available state.  When the -perm flag is not specified, the chdev command applies the changes to the device and updates the database to reflect the changes. If the -perm flag is specified, only the database is updated to reflect the changes, and the device itself is left unchanged. This is useful in cases where a device cannot be changed because it is in use; in which case, the changes can be made to the database with the -perm flag, and the changes will be applied to the device when the system is restarted. Not all devices support the -perm flag.    To protect the Configuration database, the chdev command is not interruptible. To stop this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.  The lldpsvc attribute is added to the shared Ethernet adapter (SEA) device for an automated virtual network port configuration and management in the  () Version 7 Release 7.7.0, or later. The lldpsvc attribute activates the virtual server network (VSN) capability on the SEA when you set the attribute to yes. The VSN capability can be enabled on the . The default value of the lldpsvc attribute is no. This attribute must be set to no before you remove the SEA. Flags Flag name Description -attr Attribute=Value Specifies the device attribute value pairs used for changing specific attribute values. The Attribute=Value parameter can use one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be separated by spaces. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2 lists more than one attribute value pair. -dev Name Specifies the device logical name, indicated by the Name parameter, whose characteristics are to be changed. -force  Forcefully attempts to change the device attribute. Currently supports network interface and inet0 family. -perm Changes the characteristics of the device permanently without actually changing the device. This is useful for devices that cannot be made unavailable and cannot be changed while in the available state.  By restarting the system, the changes will be applied to the device. Not all devices support the -perm flag. -restoreroute Restores routes. -udid Specifies the unique device identifier (UDID).  You cannot change attributes of the interface or the inet0 family that is used for the cluster communication. You can change the attributes by using the force option. However, this can adversely affect the membership of the cluster.   Exit StatusSee .   Examples To change the retention instructions of the 4mm SCSI tape drive rmt0 so that the drive does not move the tape to the beginning, then to the end, and then back to the beginning each time a tape is inserted or the drive is powered on, type the command as follows: chdev -dev rmt0 -attr ret=no    To change the SCSI ID of the available SCSI adapter scsi0 that cannot be made unavailable or changed due to available disk drives connected to it, type: chdev  -dev scsi0 -attr id=6 -perm  To apply the change to the adapter, shutdown and restart the system.  To restore the route, type the command as follows:chdev  -restoreroute  If you attempt to change a route by typing the following command when it is in use for the cluster communication, the system displays an error message:chdev -dev inet0 -attr route="net,-hopcount,0,,0,9.126.85.2" The system displays the following error message with return code 78:The requested operation is not allowed because partition is a member of "test_cluster" cluster.

 chpath command PurposeChanges the operational status of paths to a MultiPath I/O (MPIO) capable device, or changes an attribute associated with a path to an MPIO capable device.   Syntax chpath  Name  OpStatus [  Parent ] [  Connection ]   chpath  Name  Parent [  Connection ] [  ]  Attribute=Value...   Description The chpath command either changes the operational status of paths to the specified device (the -dev Name flag) or it changes one, or more, attributes associated with a specific path to the specified device. The required syntax is slightly different depending upon the change being made.  The first syntax shown above changes the operational status of one or more paths to a specific device. The set of paths to change is obtained by taking the set of paths which match the following criteria: The target device matches the specified device. The parent device matches the specified parent (-pdev Parent), if a parent is specified. The connection matches the specified connection (-conn Connection), if a connection is specified. The path status is PATH_AVAILABLE  The operational status of a path refers to the usage of the path as part of MPIO path selection. The value of enable indicates that the path is to be used while disable indicates that the path is not to be used. It should be noted that setting a path to disable impacts future I/O, not I/O already in progress. As such, a path can be disabled, but still have outstanding I/O until such time that all of the I/O that was already in progress completes. As such, if -op disable is specified for a path and I/O is outstanding on the path, this fact will be displayed.  Disabling a path affects path selection at the device driver level. The path_status of the path is not changed in the device configuration database. The lspath command must be used to see current operational status of a path.  The second syntax shown above changes one or more path specific attributes associated with a particular path to a particular device. Note that multiple attributes can be changed in a single invocation of the chpath command; but all of the attributes must be associated with a single path. In other words, you cannot change attributes across multiple paths in a single invocation of the chpath command. To change attributes across multiple paths, separate invocations of chpath are required; one for each of the paths that are to be changed.   Flags Flag name Description -attr Attribute=Value Identifies the attribute to change as well as the new value for the attribute. The Attribute is the name of a path specific attribute. The Value is the value which is to replace the current value for the Attribute.  The Attribute=Value parameter can use one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be enclosed in quotation marks with spaces between the pairs. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr 'Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2' lists more than one attribute value pair. -dev Name Specifies the logical device name of the target device for the path(s) affected by the change. This flag is required in all cases. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device to use in qualifying the paths to be changed. This flag is required when changing attributes, but is optional when change operational status. -perm Changes the path's characteristics without actually changing the path. The change takes effect on the path the next time the path is unconfigured and then configured (possibly on the next boot). -conn Connection Indicates the connection information to use in qualifying the paths to be changed. This flag is optional when changing operational status. When changing attributes, it is optional if the device has only one path to the indicated parent. If there are multiple paths from the parent to the device, then this flag is required to identify the specific path being changed. -op OpStatus Indicates the operational status to which the indicated paths should be changed. The operational status of a path is maintained at the device driver level. It determines if the path will be considered when performing path selection.The allowable values for this flag are:  enable  Mark the operational status as enabled for MPIO path selection. A path with this status will be considered for use when performing path selection. Note that enabling a path is the only way to recover a path from a failed condition.  disable  Mark the operational status as disabled for MPIO path selection. A path with this status will not be considered for use when performing path selection.  This flag is required when changing operational status. When used in conjunction with the -attr Attribute=Value flag, a usage error is generated.   Exit Status See .   ExamplesTo disable the paths between scsi0 and the hdisk1 disk device, enter: chpath -dev hdisk1 -pdev scsi0 -op disable The system displays a message similar to one of the following: paths disabled  or some paths disabled The first message indicates that all PATH_AVAILABLE paths from scsi0 to hdisk1 have been successfully enabled. The second message indicates that only some of the PATH_AVAILABLE paths from scsi0 to hdisk1 have been successfully disabled.

 cpvdi command Purpose Copies a block device.   Syntax cpvdi  input_disk_image   output_disk_image [ input_storage_pool] [ output_storage_pool] []    Description The cpvdi command copies a block device image, which can be either a logical or physical volume, a file-backed device, or a file on another existing disk.  The parameters of the -src and -dst flags should be fully qualified names when specifying a file or device. Specifying the -progress flag prints a number sign (#) on the stderr for each block (1 M) of data copied on to the destination.  The output_disk_image device that you specify with the -dst flag cannot be a physical volume that is assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).   Flags Flag name Description -src input_disk_image 	 Specifies the input backing device.  The input backing device might either be a physical or logical volume or a file is located in the caller's home directory, any of its subdirectories or in the /mnt directory.  The root user will not have any file location restrictions.       -dst output_disk_image Specifies the output backing device.  The output backing device might either be a physical or logical volume or a file is located in the caller's home directory, any of its subdirectories or in the /mnt directory.  The root user will not have any file location restrictions. -f  Overwrites the destination file. However, if the source or destination file is configured as backing device, it copies the file without unconfiguring the device or devices. If the -unconfigure flag is used in addition to the -f flag, then the -unconfigure flag takes priority. -progress Specifies the process status of the command will be expressed by printing a number sign (#) to stderr for every 1024 KB block of data that has been copied. -isp input_storage_pool Specifies the name of the storage pool where the input file-backed device exists. Required if the argument of the -src flag is a file-backed device. -osp output_storage_pool Specifies the name of the storage pool where the input file-backed device exists. Required if the argument of the -dst flag is a file-backed device. -overwrite  Overwrites the destination file, if the file is present. If you do not use this flag, an error message displays with a non-zero exit code. -unconfigure  Specifies to unconfigure the virtual target device (VTD) and reconfigure the VTD after a copy operation. Only use this flag if the source or destination file is configured as backing device. If you do not use this flag, an error message displays with a non-zero exit code.   Exit Status See .   Examples To copy a physical volume disk image to a file, type the following command: cpvdi -src hdisk1 -dst /home/my_home/image1_file   To copy a disk image that is a file to a physical volume, type the following command: cpvdi -src /home/my_home/image2_file -dst hdisk2 To output a hash symbol for every block of data that is copied, type the following command:  cpvdi -src hdisk1 -dst hdisk2 -progress To copy a file-backed device to another file-backed device, type the following command: cpvdi -src image1_file -dst image2_file -isp sp01 -osp sp02 To copy a file1 to file2, when file2 already exists, type the following command: cpvdi -src /home/padmin/file1 -dst /home/padmin/file2 -overwrite To copy a file-backed device fbd1 as fbd2, when fbd1 is configured as the backing device, type the following command: cpvdi -src fbd1 -dst fbd2 -isp sp01 -osp sp01 -f   Related Information The  command.

 lsmap command Purpose Displays the mapping between physical, logical, and virtual devices.   Syntax lsmap { ServerVirtualAdapter |  PhysicalLocationCode |  } [  BackingDeviceType  |  | ] [ FieldName ... ] [ Delimiter ]   lsmap  {  PagingDevice |  } [  BackingDeviceType ] [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]  lsmap  ClusterName { |  HostName} [ FieldName...  ] [  Delimiter ] lsmap  { ServerVirtualAdapter |  } [  BackingDeviceType ] [ FieldName ... ] [ Delimiter ] lsmap  ClusterName { |   HostName} Description The  command displays the mapping between the virtual host adapters and the physical devices they are backed to. Given an adapter name (ServerVirtualAdapter) or physical location code (PhysicalLocationCode) of a server virtual adapter, the device name of each connected virtual target device (child devices), its logical unit number, backing device(s), and the backing devices physical location code is displayed. If the -net flag is specified the supplied device must be a virtual server Ethernet adapter.  The -fmt flag separates the output by a user-specified delimiter/character (delimiter). The delimiter can be any non-white space character. This format is provided to facilitate scripting. When a field has no value, it is reported as a "space/blank". For example, if vhost0 has a vtopt0 entry, with no backing device, and you type the command lsmap -vadapter vhost0 -fmt : -field VTD backing status, the system displays the following output vtopt0: :Available. The -type flag limits the types of backing devices displayed to the user-specified list, BackingDeviceType.  With the exception of the net type, any combination of device types may be specified.  The net type cannot be combined with any other type.  The -npiv flag displays the server binding information between the virtual fibre channel and the physical fibre channel adapter. It is also used to display client adapter attributes that are sent to the server adapter.  The -suspend flag displays the storage that is used by a suspended client. The  command can be used to remove suspended adapters. For more information, see the Examples section of the  command topic.   Flags Flag name Description -all Specifies that the mapping information must be displayed for all the virtual SCSI devices. If the -all flag is used with the -net flag, virtual Ethernet adapters are displayed. If the flag is used with the -npiv flag, virtual fibre channel adapters are displayed. If the flag is used with the -suspend flag, suspended virtual small computer system interface (VSCSI) adapters are displayed. -ams Displays paging space device information used in active memory sharing. -clustername Specifies the cluster name. -field FieldName Specifies the list of fields to display.  The order that you specify the attributes is not guaranteed to be the same order as they are returned. The attributes of the virtual host adapter (vhostX) are always listed before the attributes of the virtual target device (VTD). You can specify the order of the attributes within the virtual host adapter and the order of the attributes within the virtual target device. But, you cannot intermix the attributes of the virtual host adapter and the attributes of the virtual target device. For virtual SCSI (default), the following fields are supported:svsa Server virtual adapter name. physloc The physical location code of the server's virtual adapter. mirrored  The backing device is part of a Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) pair. clientid Client partition ID. vtd Virtual target device. lun Logical unit number.  backing  Backing device. bdphysloc The physical location code of the backing device. status Virtual target device status.

 lsnports command Purpose Lists available ports that are capable of N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) and related information.   Syntax lsnports [  Delimiter ] [  Fieldname ]   Description The  command displays information for all the ports capable of NPIV. If you use the name of the adapter driver (for a particular physical port) in the vfcmap command, the map_port attribute is set for a virtual fibre channel adapter on the server logical partition. This attribute maps the virtual fibre channel adapter on the server logical partition to a physical fibre channel port.   Without a flag, information is displayed in a column. Specifying the -fmt flag formats the output with a specified delimiter. If no NPIV ports are in the Virtual I/O Server logical partition, the error code E_NO_NPIV_PORTS(62) is displayed.    Flags Flag name Description -fmt delimiter Specifies a delimiter character to separate output fields. -field Specifies a list of fields to be displayed. The following fields are supported: name Physical port name physloc  Physical port location code fabric  Fabric support tports  Total number of NPIV ports aports  Number of available NPIV ports swwpns Total number of target worldwide port names supported awwpns  Number of target worldwide port names available   Output Field Definitions Field Description name Physical port name physloc Physical port location code fabric Fabric support tports Total number of NPIV ports aports Number of available NPIV ports swwpns Total number of target worldwide port names supported awwpns Number of target worldwide port names available   Exit Status Return code Description 62 System does not have ports capable of NPIV.

 lspath command Purpose Displays information about paths to a MultiPath I/O (MPIO) capable device.   Syntax lspath [  DeviceName ] [  Parent ] [  Status ] [  Connection ] [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]  lspath  DeviceName   Parent [  Connection ]   [  Attribute... ] [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]  lspath  DeviceName   Parent [  Connection ]   Attribute [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]   Description The lspath command displays one of three types of information about paths to an MPIO capable device. It either displays the operational status for one or more paths to a single device, or it displays one or more attributes for a single path to a single MPIO capable device. The first syntax shown above displays the operational status for one or more paths to a particular MPIO capable device.  The second syntax displays one or more attributes for a single path to a particular MPIO capable device. Finally, the third syntax displays the possible range of values for an attribute for a single path to a particular MPIO capable device.   	  Displaying Path Status with the lspath Command 	When displaying path status, the set of paths to display is obtained by 	searching the device configuration database for paths that match the following 	criteria: 	The target device name matches the device specified with the -dev flag. If the -dev flag is not present, then 	the target device is not used in the criteria.  The parent device name matches the device specified with the -pdev flag. If the -pdev flag is not present, then 	parent is not used in the criteria.  The connection matches the connection specified with the -conn flag. If the -conn flag is not present, then 	connection is not used in the criteria. The path status matches status specified with the -status flag. If the -status flag is not present, the 	path status is not used in the criteria.  	If none of the -dev, -pdev, -conn, or -status flags are specified, 	then all paths known to the system are displayed.  	By default, this command will display the information in columnar form. 	When no flags are specified that qualify the paths to display, the format 	of the output is: 	status device  parent 	  	Possible values that can appear for the status column are: 	enabled  Indicates that the path is configured and operational. It will be considered 	when paths are selected for IO. disabled  Indicates that the path is configured, but not currently operational. 	It has been manually disabled and will not be considered when paths are selected 	for IO. failed  Indicates that the path is configured, but it has had IO failures that 	have rendered it unusable. It will not be considered when paths are selected 	for IO. defined Indicates that the path has not been configured into the device driver. missing  Indicates that the path was defined in a previous boot, but it was not 	detected in the most recent boot of the system.  detected  Indicates that the path was detected in the most recent boot of the 	system, but for some reason it was not configured. A path should only have 	this status during boot and so this status should never appear as a result 	of the lspath command.  	 Displaying Path Attributes with the lspath Command 	When displaying attributes for a path, the path must be fully qualified. 	Multiple attributes for a path can be displayed, but attributes belonging 	to multiple paths cannot be displayed in a single invocation of the lspath command. Therefore, in addition to the -lsattr, -dev, and -pdev flags, 	the -conn flags are required to uniquely identify a 	single path. For example: 	if only one path between a device and a specific parent, the -conn flag is not required if there are multiple paths between a device and a specific parent, the -conn flag is required  	Furthermore, the -status flag is not allowed.  	By default, this command will display the information in columnar form. 	attribute   value    description         user_settable  	 Flags Flag name Description -attr Attribute Identifies the specific attribute to list. The 'Attribute' is the name of a path specific attribute. When this flag is provided, only the identified attribute is displayed. Multiple instances of this flag may be used to list multiple attributes. If this flag is not specified at all, all attributes associated with the identified path will be listed.  -lsattr Displays the attribute names, current values, descriptions, and user-settable flag values for a specific path.  -dev Name Specifies the logical device name of the target device whose path information is to be displayed. -field FieldNames Specifies the list of fields to display. The following fields are supported: status  Status of the path name  Name of the device parent  Name of the parent device conn Path connection. -fmt Delimiter Specifies a delimiter character to separate output fields. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device of the path(s) to be displayed.  -range Displays the legal values for an attribute name. The -range flag displays the list attribute values in a vertical column as follows: Value1 Value2 . . ValueN The -range flag displays the range attribute values as x...n(+i) where x is the start of the range, n is the end of the range, and i is the increment.  -status Status The -status Status flag indicates the status to use in qualifying the paths to be displayed. When displaying path information, the allowable values for this flag are: enabled Display paths that are enabled for MPIO path selection. disabled Display paths that are disabled from MPIO path selection. failed Display paths that are failed due to IO errors.  available Display paths whose path_status is PATH_AVAILABLE (that is, paths that are configured in the system, includes enabled, disabled, and failed paths). defined Display paths whose path_status is PATH_DEFINED. missing Display paths whose path_status is PATH_MISSING. -conn Connection Indicates the connection information to use in qualifying the paths to be displayed.    Exit Status Return code Description 1 Invalid status value.   Examples To display, without column headers, the set of paths whose operational status is disabled, enter: lspath -status disabled The system will display a message similar to the following:   disabled  hdisk1   scsi1  disabled  hdisk2   scsi1  disabled  hdisk23  scsi8  disabled  hdisk25  scsi8 To display the set of paths whose operational status is failed, enter:  lspath -status failed  The system will display a message similar to the following:    failed  hdisk1   scsi1  failed  hdisk2   scsi1  failed  hdisk23  scsi8  failed  hdisk25  scsi8 If the target device is a SCSI disk, to display all attributes for the path to parent  scsi0 at connection 5,0, use the command:  lspath -dev hdisk10 -pdev scsi0 -conn "5,0" -lsattr The system will display a message similar to the following:  weight     1      Order of path failover selection  true         Related Information The  command, the  command, the  command, and the  command.

 mkkrb5clnt command Purpose Configures a Kerberos client. Syntax To configure Kerberos against  Network Authentication Service only:  mkkrb5clnt   | [   KDC   Realm   Server   [  Admin ]   Domain [   ] [   Database ] [  ] [   ] [  ticket_lifetime ] [  renew_lifetime ] ] [  {ldapserver | ldapserver:port} ]  To configure Kerberos against non-kadmind services:  mkkrb5clnt -h | -c KDC -r Realm -s Server -d Domain [ -i Database ] [ -K ] [ -t ticket_lifetime ] [ -n renew_lifetime ]  [ -l {ldapserver | ldapserver:port} ] | -U Description This command configures the Kerberos client. The first part of the command reads realm name, KDC, VDB path, and domain name from the input and generates a krb5.conf file.  Item Description /etc/krb5/krb5.conf: Values for realm name, Kerberos admin server, and domain name are set as specified on the command line. Also updates the paths for default_keytab_name, kdc, and kadmin log files.  If DCE is not configured, this command creates a link to /etc/krb5/krb5.conf from /etc/krb5.conf.  The command also allows you to configure root as admin user, configure integrated Kerberos authentication, and configure  Kerberos as default authentication scheme.  For integrated login, the -i flag requires the name of the database being used. For LDAP, use the load module name that specifies LDAP. For local files, use the keyword files.  Item Description Standard Output Consists of information messages when the -h flag is used. Standard Error Consists of error messages when the command cannot complete successfully. Flags  Item Description -a Admin Specifies the principal name of the Kerberos server admin. -A Specifies root to be added as a Kerberos administrative user. -c KDC Specifies the KDC server. -d Domain Specifies the complete domain name for the Kerberos client. -D Specifies Kerberos against non-kadmind services. -h Specifies that the command is only to display the valid command syntax. -i Database Configures integrated Kerberos authentication. -K Specifies Kerberos to be configured as the default authentication scheme. -l ldapserver | ldapserver:port For servers, specifies the LDAP directory used to store the Network Authentication Service principal and policy information. For clients, specifies the LDAP directory server to use for Administration server and KDC discovery using LDAP. If the -l flag is used, then the KDC and server flags are optional. If the -l option is not used, the KDC and server flags must be specified. The port number can optionally be specified.  For clients and servers, the port number can optionally be specified. If the port number is not specified, the client connects to the default LDAP server port 389 or 636 for SSL connections.   Only the client configuration is updated. -n renew_lifetime Specifies the client-specific time to generate a renewable ticket if the server supports it. By default, the ticket is nonrenewable. The renew_lifetime parameter value is composed of four numeric values that are delimited by colons. -r Realm Specifies the full realm name for which the Kerberos client is to be configured. -s Server Specifies the fully qualified host name for Kerberos admin server. -t ticket_lifetime Specifies the client-specific ticket lifetime for received tickets if the server supports it. If you do not specify the flag, the server sets the ticket lifetime. The ticket_lifetime parameter value is composed of four numeric values that are delimited by colons. -T Specifies the flag to acquire server admin TGT based admin ticket. -U Undo the setup from the previous configuration command.

 mkpath command Purpose Adds to the system another path to an MPIO capable device.   Syntax mkpath { [ -dev Name ] [  Parent ] [  Connection ] } [  ]   Description The mkpath command defines, and possibly configures, one or more paths to the target device (-dev Name). The paths are identified by a combination of the -dev Name, -pdev Parent, and -conn Connection flags. Both the target device and parent must be previously defined in the system to define a path. They both must be AVAILABLE to configure a path.  If the -def flag is specified, the mkpath command only defines the new path definition to the system. If the -def flag is not specified, the mkpath command attempts to define the path, if it does not already exist, before it attempts to configure the path. Configuring a path requires the path to already be defined and both the device and the parent device to already be configured.  The mkpath command displays a status message upon completion. It is possible for some paths to configure and others to fail.  Note that not all devices will be able to have paths manually defined by using the mkpath command. These limitations are due to the way that path information is stored for these devices. Fiber channel devices fall into this category.  The mkpath command provides status messages about the results of operation. Messages in one of the following formats will be generated: path [ available | defined ]  This message is displayed when mkpath is run on a single path. If the path is successfully configured the message path available is displayed. If the path is not successfully configured and there is no explicit error code returned by the method, the message path defined is displayed. paths available  This message is displayed if multiple paths were identified and all paths were successfully configured.  some paths available  This message is displayed if multiple paths were identified, but only some of them were successfully configured.  no paths processed  This message is generated if no paths were found matching the selection criteria.   Flags Flag name Description -conn Connection Indicates the connection information associated with the path to be added. This flag is required if the -def flag is specified. -def Defines a new path to a device by adding a path definition to the system. The new path will not automatically be configured when the -def flag is specified. Note that only one path may be defined at a time. The -conn and the -pdev flags are required when the -def flag is used. -dev Name Specifies the logical device name of the target device to which the path(s) are being added. The path(s) to be added are qualified by the -pdev and -conn flags. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device associated with the path(s) to be added. This flag is required if the -def flag is specified.   Exit Status See .   Examples To define and configure an already defined path between scsi0 and the hdisk1 device at SCSI ID 5 and LUN 0 (connection 5,0), enter: mkpath -dev hdisk1 -pdev scsi0 -conn 5,0 The system displays the following message: path available   To configure an already defined path from fscsi0 to fiber channel disk hdisk1, type: mkpath -dev hdisk1 -pdev fscsi0 The system displays the following message: path available    To only add to the Customized Paths object class a path definition between scsi0 and the hdisk1 disk device at SCSI ID 5 and LUN 0, enter: mkpath -def -dev hdisk1 -pdev scsi0 -conn 5,0 The system displays the following message: path defined      Related InformationThe  command and the  command.

 mkvdev command Purpose Adds a virtual device to the system.   Syntax To create a virtual target device:  mkvdev [  ] {  TargetDevice |  TDPhysicalLocationCode } {  VirtualServerAdapter |  VSAPhysicalLocationCode}  [  DeviceName ]  To create a virtual target device for a file backed virtual optical device:  mkvdev   {  VirtualServerAdapter |  VSAPhysicalLocationCode }  [ DeviceName]  To create a virtual target device when the backup device is part of a Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) pair: mkvdev [  ] {  TargetDevice |  TDPhysicalLocationCode } {  VirtualServerAdapter |  VSAPhysicalLocationCode} {  mirrored=true } [  DeviceName ] To create a shared Ethernet adapter:  mkvdev [  TargetDevice  VirtualEthernetAdapter... DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter   SEADefaultPVID [  Attribute=Value  [ Attribute=Value... ]] [ []]  The shared Ethernet adapter attributes, ha_mode and ctl_chan, must be specified together. The command fails if only one attribute is specified. These attributes are used to create a shared Ethernet adapter in a failover configuration.  To create an Link Aggregation adapter:  mkvdev TargetAdapter... [  Attribute=Value [ Attribute=Value... ] ] [   [ -interface TargetInterface ] ]  To create a VLAN Ethernet adapter:  mkvdev   TargetAdapter  TagID   Description The mkvdev command creates a virtual device.  The name of the virtual device is automatically generated and assigned unless the -dev DeviceName flag is specified, in which case DeviceName becomes the device name.  If the backup device is part of a PPRC pair, set the mirrored attribute to TRUE to create the virtual target device.  This allows a  PPRC secondary device to be exported to the client partition. If the -lnagg flag is specified, a Link Aggregation or IEEE 802.3 Link Aggregation (automatic Link Aggregation) device is created. To create an IEEE 802.3 Link Aggregation set the mode attribute to 8023ad. If the -sea flag is specified, a shared Ethernet adapter is created. The TargetDevice may be a Link Aggregation adapter (note, however, that the VirtualEthernetAdapter  may not be Link Aggregation adapters). The default virtual Ethernet adapter, DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter, must also be included as one of the virtual Ethernet adapters, VirtualEthernetAdapter.    The -vlan flag is used to create a VLAN device and the -vdev flag creates a virtual target device which maps the VirtualServerAdapter to the TargetDevice.  If the backup device that is specified by the -vdev or -dplc flags is already in use, an error is returned unless the -f flag is also specified.   The mkvdev command also configures virtual optical devices, where the -vdev or -dplc flag specifies the physical optical device and the -vadapter or -aplc flag specifies the virtual SCSI adapter. If the specified optical device is already assigned to a virtual SCSI adapter, an error is returned unless the -f flag is also specified. If the -f flag is specified, the optical device will be removed from the virtual SCSI adapter it is currently assigned to before reassigning it to the new virtual SCSI adapter. When an additional disk drive that has a lower max_transfer_size than the current setting is added, and it is set as a virtual target device (processing mkvdev), the client cannot recognize this device until the VIOS is rebooted and the max_transfer_size is reestablished to the new setting. Because the max_transfer_size cannot be dynamically changed, the mkvdev  command checks the current max_transfer_size of the device being added. If it is lower, it posts a message stating that the VIOS must be rebooted before the client can see this device.   To protect the Configuration Database, the mkvdev command is not interruptible. Stopping this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.   Flags Flag name Description -aplc VSAPhysicalLocationCode Specifies the virtual SCSI adapter using the physical location code -attr Attribute=Value Specifies the device attribute value pairs to be used instead of the defaults. The Attribute=Value variable can be used to specify one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be enclosed in quotation marks with a blank space between the pairs. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr 'Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2' lists more than one attribute value pair.  -auto Migrates and restores the Ethernet interface when you create a shared Ethernet adapter with the -migrate option. -default DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter  Default virtual adapter to use for non-VLAN-tagged packets.  This flag maps to the shared Ethernet adapter device attribute pvid_adapter. -defaultid SEADefaultPVID  The SEADefaultPVID is the VID used for untagged frames.  All untagged packets are assigned the SEADefaultPVID value.   When a tagged frame is received by a port, the tag is used.  Otherwise if the frame is untagged, the value contained in the PVID is considered as a tag.  This flag maps to the shared Ethernet adapter device attribute pvid. -dev DeviceName By using the -dev flag, you can specify the name you want the device to be known by. If you do not use the -dev flag, a name will be automatically generated and assigned. Not all devices support user-supplied names. -dplc TDPhysicalLocationCode Specifies the physical device using the physical location code -f Force the physical volume specified to be used as a backup device, even if it's already associated with a virtual SCSI adapter. If the specified backup device is an optical device, -f forces the optical device to be removed from the virtual SCSI adapter to which it is currently assigned, before reassigning it to the new virtual SCSI adapter. The -f flag can also be used to force the mkvdev command to continue working when it fails, because the device is in use as a cluster device. The user must know every host to which the disk is visible and how it is used, before forcing the mkvdev command to continue working. -fbo Create a virtual optical device. -lnagg TargetAdapter... Creates a Link Aggregation device. -migrate Migrates the settings from the physical adapter interface to the shared Ethernet adapter interface. -sea TargetDevice  Creates a shared Ethernet adapter which maps VirtualEthernetAdapter  to the adapter TargetDevice.  TargetDevice can be a physical adapter or a Link Aggregation adapter. -tagid TagID Specifies the VLAN tag ID. -vadapter VirtualEthernetAdapter or VirtualServerAdapter Specifies the virtual server adapter or virtual Ethernet adapter the new device will be mapped to. If multiple virtual Ethernet adapters are specified, separate the adapter names with commas and no spaces.  -vdev TargetDevice  Creates a virtual device mapped to the physical/logical device TargetDevice and the virtual server adapter VirtualServerAdapter. The TargetDevice can be either a physical volume, logical volume, USB HD, or optical device. Physical volumes assigned to volume groups cannot be used as target devices. -vlan TargetAdapter Creates a Virtual Local Area Network device.    While you create the shared Ethernet adapter, -auto and -migrate options do not support the migration of an IPv6 stateless configuration.   Exit Status Return code Description 13 Specified physical or logical volume is not a valid. 21 Device is already in use. Use the -f flag to force assignment. 22 Logical volumes cannot be assigned as backup devices more than once.   Examples To create a virtual target device that maps the logical volume lv20 as a virtual disk for a client partition hosted by the vhost0 virtual server adapter, type the following command: mkvdev -vdev lv20 -vadapter vhost0 The system displays the following message: vtscsi0 available To create a virtual target device that maps the physical volume hdisk6 as a virtual disk for a client partition served by the vhost2 virtual server adapter, type the following command: mkvdev -vdev hdisk6 -vadapter vhost2 The system displays the following message: vtscsi1 available To create a virtual target device that maps physical tape device rmt0 as a virtual tape device for a client partition served by the vhost2 virtual server adapter, type the following command:   mkvdev -vdev rmt0 -vadapter vhost2 The system displays the following message: vttape0 available To create a shared Ethernet adapter that maps the physical Ethernet adapter ent4 as a virtual Ethernet adapter for the client partitions served by the virtual Ethernet adapters ent6, ent7, and ent9, using ent6 as the default adapter and 8 as the default ID, type the following command: mkvdev -sea ent4 -vadapter ent6 ent7 ent9 -default ent6 -defaultid 8 The system displays the following message: ent10 available To create a shared Ethernet adapter in failover configuration with the control channel adapter ent5, create the shared Ethernet adapter as shown in example 4, but specify additional attributes ha_mode and ctl_chan with -attr.

 prepdev command Purpose Prepares a device to be assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).   Syntax prepdev { -dev devicename }   Description The prepdev command prepares a device to be assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition). This command determines whether the device specified by the -dev flag is already assigned or used in the following manner:Assigned to a shared memory pool (being used as a paging device) Used as a backup device for virtual SCSI Used by a file system, logical volume, or volume group. If the device is already being used or assigned to a shared memory pool, you receive system output that tells you how to prepare the device to be used as a paging space device.   Flags Flag name Description -dev devicename Specifies the logical device to be used as a paging space device.  --help Displays the help text for this command and exit.    Exit Status See .

 rmdev command Purpose Removes a device from the system.   Syntax rmdev {  |  } Name  [  ] [  ] [  ]   Description The rmdev command unconfigures and undefines the device specified with the device logical name. If you specify the -recursive flag, the rmdev command acts on any children of the device as well. By specifying the -ucfg flag the device will be unconfigured but not undefined.  Use the -pdev flag along with the parent device's logical name to delete all of the children devices. The children are deleted in the same recursive fashion as described above for the -recursive flag. The only difference is that the specified device itself is not deleted. Thus, the -recursive flag is redundant and need not be specified with the -pdev flag.   To protect the Configuration database, the rmdev command cannot be interrupted. Stopping this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.   The device specified or the children of the device specified cannot be a physical or logical volume that is assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).  You cannot remove the interface or inet0 that is used for the shared storage pool communication.   Flags Flag name Description -dev Name Specifies the logical device, indicated by the Name parameter. This flag may not be used with the -pdev flag. -pdev Name Specifies the parent logical device (indicated by the Name parameter whose children need to be removed. This flag may not be used with the -dev flag. -recursive Unconfigures the device and its children. -ucfg Unconfigures, but does not undefine the specified device. The device's state will be moved from Available to Defined. To move the device back to Available state run cfgdev -dev Name command. -f Forcefully removes or unconfigures the device even if it is in use.  This option can be used only with the physical volumes in cluster environment, where the device is not used in the active cluster of the system.   Exit Status See .   Examples To unconfigure the cd0 CD-ROM device, type the command as follows: rmdev  -dev cd0   To unconfigure the SCSI adapter scsi1 and all of its children, type the command as follows:  rmdev  -recursive -dev scsi1   To unconfigure just the children of the SCSI adapter scsi1, but not the adapter itself, type the command as follows: rmdev  -pdev scsi1    To unconfigure the children of PCI bus pci1 and all other devices under them, type the command as follows: rmdev  -pdev pci1    To remove the suspended virtual adapter and all the children, type the command as follows:rmdev -dev susadpt0 -recursive The system displays the following output:vtscsi0            deleted client_rootvg      deleted susadpt0           deleted  If you attempt to remove the interface that is used for cluster communication by typing the command as follows:rmdev -dev en0 The system displays the following error message with return code 78:The requested operation is not allowed because partition is a member of "test_cluster" cluster.

 rmpath command Purpose Removes from the system a path to an MPIO-capable device.   Syntax rmpath  { [  Name ] [  Parent ] [  Connection ] } [  ]   Description The rmpath command unconfigures, and possibly undefines, one or more paths associated with the specified target device (-dev Name). The set of paths that is removed is determined by the combination of the -dev Name, -pdev Parent and -conn Connection flags. If the command will result in all paths associated with the device being unconfigured or undefined, the command will exit with an error and without unconfiguring or undefining any path. In this situation, rmdev command must be used instead to unconfigure or undefine the target device itself.  The default action unconfigures each specified path, but does not completely remove it from the system. If the -rm flag is specified, the rmpath command unconfigures (if necessary) and removes, or deletes, the path definition(s) from the system.  When the rmpath command finishes, it displays a status message. When unconfiguring paths, it is possible for this command to be able to unconfigure some paths and not others (for example, paths that are in the process of doing I/O cannot be unconfigured).  The rmpath command provides status messages about the results of operation. Messages in one of the following formats will be generated: path [ defined | deleted ]  This message is displayed when a single path was successfully unconfigured or undefined. If the path is successfully configured the message path available displays. If the path is not successfully configured and there is no explicit error code returned by the method, the message path defined displays.  paths [defined | deleted]  This message is displayed if multiple paths were identified and all paths were successfully unconfigured or undefined. If the -rm flag is not specified, the message would be paths defined. If the -rm flag is specified, the message would be paths deleted.  some paths [ defined | deleted ]  This message is display if multiple paths were identified, but only some of them were successfully unconfigured or undefined. If the -rm flag is not specified, the message would be some paths defined. If the -rm flag is specified, the message would be some paths deleted. no paths processed  This message is generated if no paths were found matching the selection criteria.    Flags Flag name Description -rm  Indicates that the specified paths are to be deleted from the system. -dev Name  Specifies the logical device name of the target device whose path is to be removed. The paths to be removed are qualified via the -pdev and -conn flags. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device to use in qualifying the paths to be removed. Since all paths to a device cannot be removed by this command, either this flag, the -conn flag, or both must be specified. -conn Connection Indicates the connection information to use in qualifying the paths to be removed. Since all paths to a device cannot be removed by this command, either this flag, the -pdev flag, or both must be specified.   Exit Status See .   Examples 1.

 rmvdev command Purpose To remove the connection between a physical device and its associated virtual SCSI adapter.   Syntax rmvdev [  ] {  TargetDevice  |  VirtualTargetDevice }  [] To remove a shared Ethernet adapter: rmvdev { SEAdevice} [ ] To remove a Link Aggregation adapter: rmvdev { LnaggDevice} [  [ TargetInterface]]   Description The rmvdev command removes the connection between a physical device and its associated virtual SCSI adapter. The connection can be identified by specifying the backing (physical) device or the virtual target device. If  the connection is specified by the device name and there are multiple connections between the physical device and virtual SCSI adapters and error is returned unless the -f flag is also specified.  If -f is included then all connections associated with the physical device are removed.    If the backing (physical) device is a logical volume and the -rmlv flag is specified, then logical volume will be removed as well.   Flags Flag name Description -f Forces the removal of all virtual target devices associated with the given backing device. -vdev TargetDevice Specifies the physical backing device -rmlv Deletes the backing device. This flag is valid only for logical volume backing devices. -vtd VirtualTargetDevice Specifies the virtual target device to remove. -sea SEAdevice Removes the Shared Ethernet Adapter -auto Migrates and removes the shared Ethernet adapter when used with the -migrate option. -migrate Migrates the settings from the physical adapter interface to the shared Ethernet adapter interface. -lnagg LnaggDevice Removes a Link Aggregation device. -interface TargetInterface Deleted the interfaces configured on the system for the target interface.   Exit Status See .

 save_base command Purpose Saves information about base-customized devices in the Device Configuration database for the boot device.   Syntax save_base [ Directory][ File][]   Description The save_base command stores customized information for base devices to use during phase 1 of system boot. By default, the save_base command retrieves this information from the /etc/objrepos directory. However, you can override this action by using the -o flag to specify an ODM directory. The save_base command is typically run without any parameters. It uses the /dev/ipl_blv special file link to identify the output destination.  Alternatively, use the -d flag to specify a destination file or a device, such as the /dev/hdisk0 device file. To identify a specific output destination, the -d flag identifies the file to which save_base writes the base customized device data. This file can be either a regular file or a device special file. The device special file identifies either a disk device special file or a boot logical volume device special file.  A disk device special file can be used where there is only one boot logical volume on the disk. The save_base command ensures that the given disk has only one boot logical volume present. If neither of these conditions is true, save_base does not save the base customized device data to the disk and exits with an error.    When a second boot logical volume is on a disk, the boot logical volume device special file must be used as the destination device to identify which boot image the base customized device data will be stored in. A boot logical volume device special file can be used even if there is only one boot logical volume on the disk. The save_base command ensures that the given device special file is a boot logical volume and it is bootable before saving any data to it. If either of these checks fails, save_base exits with an error.  The save_base command determines what device information to save using the PdDv.base field corresponding to each entry in the CuDv object class. Specifically, the PdDv.base field is a bit mask which represents the type of boot for which this device is a base device. The save_base command determines the current type of boot by accessing the boot_mask attribute in the CuAt object class. The value of this attribute is the bit mask to apply to the PdDv.base field to determine which devices are base.    Base devices are those devices that get configured during phase 1 boot; they may vary depending on the type of boot (mask). For example, if the mask is NETWORK_BOOT, network devices are considered base; for DISK_BOOT, disk devices are considered base. The type of boot masks are defined in the /usr/include/sys/cfgdb.h file.  The -m flag is no longer used by the save_base command. For compatibility reasons, the flag can be specified, but is not used.   Flags Flag name Description -path Directory  Specifies a directory containing the Device Configuration database.  By default, the save_base command retrieves this information from the /etc/objrepos directory. -file file Specifies the destination file or device to which the base information will be written. -verbose Specifies that verbose output is to be written to standard output (STDIN).   Exit Status See .   Examples  To save the base customized information and see verbose output, type the following command: save_base -verbose To specify an ODM directory other than the /usr/lib/objrepos directory, type the following command: save_base -o /tmp/objrepos To save the base customized information to the /dev/hdisk0 device file instead of to the boot disk, type the following command: save_base -d /dev/hdisk0     Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 snmpv3_ssw command Purpose Switch the symbolic links among the non-encrypted snmpdv3 agent, encrypted snmpdv3 agent and snmpdv1 agent.

 bootlist command Purpose Displays and alters the list of boot devices available to the system.   Syntax bootlist -mode mode {[  -ls  ] [ [ -rm ]  | [  Device [ -attr Attribute=Value ... ] ... ] ] }   Description The bootlist command allows the user to display and alter the list of possible boot devices from which the system may be booted. When the system is booted, it will scan the devices in the list and attempt to boot from the first device it finds containing a boot image. This command supports the updating of the following:  Service boot list. The service list designates possible boot devices for when the system is booted in service mode. How a system is booted in service mode is hardware-platform dependent. It may require a key switch to be turned to the Service position, a particular function key to be pressed during the boot process, or some other mechanism, as defined for the particular hardware platform. Previous boot device entry. This entry designates the last device from which the system booted. Some hardware platforms may attempt to boot from the previous boot device before looking for a boot device in one of the other lists.  The bootlist command supports the specification of generic device types as well as specific devices for boot candidates.  Devices in the boot device list occur in the same order as devices listed on the invocation of this command.  The selection of the boot list to display or alter is made with the -mode mode option, where the mode variable is one of the keywords: service, normal, both, or prevboot. If the both keyword is specified, then both the normal boot list and the service boot list will be displayed, or if being altered, will be set to the same list of devices. If the prevboot keyword is specified, the only alteration allowed is with the -rm flag . The -rm flag invalidates the boot list specified by the -mode flag.  The devices currently in the boot list may be displayed by using the -ls flag. The list of devices that make up the specified boot list will be displayed, one device per line. If a device specified in the boot list is no longer present on the system, a '-' is displayed instead of a name.   When you add a hot plug adapter to the system, that adapter and its child devices might not be available for specification as a boot device when you use the bootlist command. You may be required to reboot your system to make all potential boot devices known to the operating system.   Device Choices 	The device name specified on the command line can occur in one of two different 	forms:   	It can indicate a specific device by its device logical name. It can indicate a generic or special device type by keyword. The following generic device keywords are supported:   	Keywords Description fd   Any standard I/O-attached diskette drive scdisk   Any SCSI-attached disk (including serial-link disk drives) badisk   Any direct bus-attached disk cd   Any SCSI-attached CD-ROM rmt   Any SCSI-attached tape device  ent   Any Ethernet adapter fddi   Any Fiber Distributed Data Interface adapter  	When a specific device is to be included in the device list, the 	device's logical name (used with system management commands) must be specified. 	This logical name is made up of a prefix and a suffix. The suffix is generally 	a number and designates the specific device. The specified device must be 	in the Available state. If it is not, the update to the device list is rejected and this command fails. The following devices and their associated logical 	names are supported (where the bold type is the prefix and the xx variable is the device-specific suffix):    	Device name Description fdxx    Diskette-drive device logical names hdiskxx    Physical-volume device logical names cdxx    SCSI CD-ROM device logical names rmtxx    Magnetic-tape device logical names entxx   Ethernet-adapter logical names fddixx   Fiber Distributed Data Interface adapter logical names  	 Attribute Choices 	Attributes are extra pieces of information about a device that the user 	supplies on the command line. Since this information is specific to a particular 	device, generic devices do not have attributes. Attributes apply to the device 	that immediately precedes them on the command line, which allows attributes 	to be interspersed among devices on the command line. Currently, only network 	devices have attributes. These are:  	Attribute Description bserver IP address of the BOOTP server gateway IP address of the gateway client IP address of the client speed Network adapter speed duplex The mode of the network adapter  	 Error Handling 	If this command returns with an error, the device lists are not altered. 	The following device list errors are possible:  	If the user attempts to display or alter a boot list that is not supported 	by the hardware platform, the command fails, indicating the mode is not supported. If the user attempts to add too many devices to the boot list, the command 	fails, indicating that too many devices were requested. The number of devices 	supported varies depending on the device selection and the hardware platform 	. If an invalid keyword, invalid flag, or unknown device is specified, the 	command fails with the appropriate error message.  If a specified device is not in the Available state, the command 	fails with the appropriate error message.   	 Flags  Flag name Description Device Provides the names of the specific or generic devices to include in the boot list. -attr Attribute=Value Specifies the device attribute value pairs to be used instead of the defaults. The Attribute=Value variable can be used to specify one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be enclosed in quotation marks with a blank space between the pairs. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr 'Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2' lists more than one attribute value pair. -mode Mode Specifies which boot list to  display or  alter. Possible values for the mode variable are normal, service, both, or prevboot. -ls Indicates that the specified boot list is to be displayed after any specified alteration is performed. The output is a list of device names. -rm Indicates that the device list specified by the -mode flag should be invalidated.   Exit Status See .   Examples To invalidate the Service mode boot list, type:   bootlist -mode service -rm To make a boot list for Normal mode with devices listed on the command line, type:   bootlist -mode normal hdisk0 hdisk1 rmt0 fd To attempt to boot through a gateway using Ethernet, and then try other devices, type a command similar to the following. Substitute the IP addresses specified in the example with your IP addresses.   bootlist -mode normal ent0 -attr gateway=129.35.21.1 bserver=129.12.2.10 \ client=129.35.9.23 hdisk0 rmt0 tok0 bserver=129.35.10.19 hdisk1   Related Information The  command.

 backup command To back up a file system by i-node, specify the -Level and FileSystem parameters. When used in conjunction with the -u  flag, the -Level parameter provides a method of maintaining a hierarchy of incremental backups for each file system. Specify the -u flag and set the -Level parameter to n to back up only those files that have been modified since the n-1 level back up.  The possible back up levels are 0 to 9. A level 0 back up archives all files in the file system. The FileSystem parameter can specify either the physical device name (block or raw name) or the name of the directory on which the file system is mounted. The default file system is the root (/) file system.  Users must have read access to the file system device (such as /dev/hd4) or have back up authorization to perform backups by i_node.  You must first unmount a file system before backing it up by i-node. If you attempt to back up a mounted file system, a warning message is displayed. The backup command continues, but the created back up might contain inconsistencies because of changes that might have occurred in the file system during the back up operation.  Backing up file systems by i-node truncates the uid or gid of files having a uid or gid greater than 65535. When restored, these files might have different values for the uid and gid attributes. To retain the values correctly, always back up by name those files that have a uid or gid greater than 65535.  You can archive only JFS (Journaled File System) file systems when backing up by i-node. Back up any non-JFS file systems by file name.   Purpose Backs up files and file systems.   Syntax To back up files by name:  backup  [  Number ] [  [  RegularExpression ] ] [ {force|ignore|warn} ] [ Device ] [  Number ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ]  To back up file systems by i-node:  backup [ [  ] [  Number ] [ ] [ Device ] [  Length ] [  ] [  ] ] [ FileSystem ] | [  |  ] [  ]   Description The backup command creates copies of your files on a back up medium, such as a magnetic tape or diskette. The copies are in one of the two back up formats:  Specific files backed up by name using the -i flag. Entire file system backed up by i-node using the Level and FileSystem parameters.  If you issue the backup command without any parameters, the root file system level 9 i-node back ups to the /dev/rfd0 device. The default syntax is: -9uf/dev/rfd0 /dev/rhd4  The default back up device is /dev/rfd0. If flags are specified that are not appropriate for the specified back up device, the backup command displays an error message and continues with the back up. A single back up can span multiple volumes.  Running the backup command results in the loss of all material previously stored on the selected output medium. Data integrity of the archive might be compromised if a file is modified during system back up. Keep system activity at a minimum during the system back up procedure. If a back up is made to a tape device with the device block size set to 0, it might be difficult to restore data from the tape unless the default write size was used with the backup command. The default write size for the backup command can be read by the restore command when the tape device block size is 0.  In other words, the -b flag should not be specified when the tape device block size is 0. If the -b flag of the backup command is specified and is different from the default size, the same size must be specified with the -b flag of the restore command when the archived files are restored from the tape.    Backing up files by name To back up by name, use the -i flag. The backup command reads standard input for the names of the files to be backed up.  File types can be special files, regular files, or directories. When the file type is a directory, only the directory is backed up. The files under the directory are not backed up, unless they are explicitly specified.  Files are restored using the same path names as the archived files. Therefore, to create a back up that can be restored from any path, use full path names for the files that you want to back up.  When backing up files that require multiple volumes, do not enter the list of file names from the keyboard. Instead, pipe or redirect the list from a file to the backup command.   When you enter the file names from the keyboard and the back up process needs a new tape or diskette, the command loses any file names already entered but not yet backed up. To avoid this problem, enter each file name only after the archived message for the previous file has been displayed. The archived message consists of the character a followed by the file name.  If you specify the -p flag, only files of less than 2 GB are packed.    Backing up file systems by i-node To back up a file system by i-node, specify the -Level and FileSystem parameters. When used in conjunction with the -u flag, the -Level parameter provides a method of maintaining a hierarchy of incremental backups for each file system. Specify the -u flag and set the -Level parameter to n to back up only those files that have been modified since the n-1 level backup. Information regarding the date, time, and level of each incremental backup is written to the /etc/dumpdates file. The possible backup levels are 0 to 9. A level 0 backup archives all files in the file system. If the /etc/dumpdates file contains no backup information for a particular file system, specifying any level causes all files in that file system to be archived.   The FileSystem parameter can specify either the physical device name (block or raw name) or the name of the directory on which the file system is mounted. The default file system is the root (/) file system. Users must have read access to the file system device (such as /dev/hd4) or have Backup authorization in order to perform backups by i_node. You must first unmount a file system before backing it up by i-node. If you attempt to back up a mounted file system, a warning message is displayed. The backup command continues, but the created backup may contain inconsistencies because of changes that may have occurred in the file system during the backup operation. Backing up file systems by i-node truncates the uid or gid of files having a uid or gid greater than 65535. When restored, these files may have different values for the uid and gid attributes. To retain the values correctly, always back up by name files having a uid or gid greater than 65535. You can archive only JFS (Journaled File System) file systems when backing up by i-node. Back up any non-JFS file systems by file name or by using other archive commands, such as the pax, tar, or cpio command  The -Z flag is mandatory for backing up encrypted file systems.   FlagsFlag name Description -b Number  For backups by name, specifies the number of 512-byte blocks; for backups by i-node, specifies the number of 1024-byte blocks to write in a single output operation. When the backup command writes to tape devices, the default is 100 for backups by name and 32 for backups by i-node.   The write size is the number of blocks multiplied by the block size. The default write size for the backup command writing to tape devices is 51200 (100 Ã 512) for backups by name and 32768 (32 Ã 1024) for backups by i-node. The write size must be an even multiple of the tape's physical block size.  The value of the -b flag is always ignored when the backup command writes to diskette.  -c Specifies that the tape is a cartridge, not a nine-track. -e RegularExpression Specifies that the files with names matching the regular expression are not to be packed. A regular expression is a set of characters, meta characters, and operators that define a string or group of strings in a search pattern. It can also be a string containing wildcard characters and operations that define a set of one or more possible strings. The -e flag is applied only when the -p flag is specified. -ejt Rewinds the tape and takes the tape drive offline. This will unload the tape when appropriate. The tape must be re-inserted before the device can be used again. -E For backups by name, the -E flag requires one of the following arguments. If you omit the -E option, warn is the default behavior.  force Fails the back up operation on a file if the fixed extent size or space reservation of the file cannot be preserved. ignore Ignores any errors in preserving extent attributes. warn Issues a warning if the space reservation or the fixed extent size of the file cannot be preserved.  -f Device  Specifies the output device. To send output to a named device, specify the Device variable as a path name such as the following example: /dev/rmt0 To send output to the standard output device, specify a - (minus sign). The - (minus sign) feature enables you to pipe the output of the backup command to the dd command.  You can also specify a range of archive devices. The range specification must be in the following format: /dev/deviceXXX-YYY where XXX and YYY are whole numbers, and XXX must always be less than YYY; for example:  /dev/rfd0-3  All devices in the specified range must be of the same type. For example, you can use a set of 8 mm, 2.3 GB tapes or a set of 1.44 MB diskettes. All tape devices must be set to the same physical tape block size.  If the Device variable specifies a range, the backup command automatically goes from one device in the range to the next. After exhausting all of the specified devices, the backup command stops and requests that new volumes be mounted on the range of devices. F Â  G Â  i Specifies that files be read from standard input and archived by file name. If relative path names are used, files are restored (with the restore command) relative to the current directory at restore time. If full path names are used, files are restored to those same names. -L Length Specifies the length of the tape in bytes. This flag overrides the -c, -d, and -s flags. You can specify the size with a suffix of b, k, m, or g to represent blocks (512 bytes), kilo (1024 bytes), mega (1024 KB), or giga (1024 MB), respectively. To represent a tape length of 2 GB, enter -L 2g.    Use the -L flag only for i-node backups. -Level Specifies the backup level (0 to 9). The default level is 9. -l Number Limits the total number of blocks to use on the diskette device. The value specified must be a nonzero multiple of the number of sectors per diskette track. This option applies to by-name backups only.  -o Creates a Version 2-compatible back up by name. This flag is required for compatibility with Version 2 systems because backups by name that are created by a version higher than 2 cannot be restored on Version 2 systems. To create a Version 2-compatible back up by name, use the -o flag along with other flags required for backups by name.Files with attributes and values, such as user IDs and group IDs, that are too large for Version 2 systems are not backed up. A message is displayed for each such file and each value that is too large. -p Specifies that the files be packed, or compressed, before they are archived. Only files smaller than 2 GB are packed.    This option should only be used when backing up files from an inactive file system. Modifying a file when a back up is in progress might result in corruption of the back up and an inability to recover the data. When backing up to a tape device that performs compression, this option can be omitted. -q Indicates that the removable medium is ready to use. When you specify the -q flag, the backup command proceeds without prompting you to prepare the back up medium. Press the Enter key to continue. This option applies only to the first volume. You are prompted for subsequent volumes. The -q flag applies only to backups by name. -U Specifies to back up any access control list (ACL)s or named extended attributes. Without this option the image will include only   and Printing Color Files (PCLs) in the archive along with the other regular file data.  -u Updates the /etc/dumpdates file with the raw device name of the file system and the time, date, and level of the back up. You must specify the -u flag if you are making incremental backups. The -u flag applies only to backups by i-node. -v Causes the backup command to display additional information about the back up. When using the -v flag, the size of the file as it exists on the archive is displayed in bytes. Additionally, a total of these file sizes is displayed when all files have been processed. Directories are listed with a size of 0. Symbolic links are listed with the size of the symbolic link. Hard links are listed with the size of the file, which is how hard links are archived. Block and character devices, if they were backed up, are listed with a size of 0.  When the -v flag is not specified, the backup command displays only the names of the files being archived. This option is used only when backing up by file name. -w Disabled. If the -w flag is specified, no other flags are applied. -W Displays, for each file system in the /etc/dumpdates file, the most recent back up date and level. If the -W flag is specified, no other flags are applied.   Exit Status This command returns the following exit values:  Return code Description 0   Successful completion. >0   An error occurred.   Examples To back up all the files and subdirectories in the /home directory using full path names, type the following command:  find /home -print | backup  -i -f /dev/rmt0  The -i flag specifies that files will be read from standard input and archived by the file name. The find command generates a list of all the files in the /home directory. The files in this list are full path names. The | (pipe symbol) causes this list to be read from standard input by the backup command. The -f flag directs the backup command to write the files to the /dev/rmt0 tape device. Because the files are archived using full path names, they will be written to the same paths when restored. To back up all the files and subdirectories in the /home/padmin directory using relative path names, type the following command:  find . -print | backup  -i -v -q  Each file name in the list generated by the find command is preceded by ./ (dot, slash). Because the files are backed up using relative path names, they are written to the current directory when restored. The -v flag causes the backup command to display additional information about the backup. The files are written to the default backup device /dev/rfd0. To back up the / (root) file system, type the following command:  backup  -0 -u -f /dev/rmt0 /  The 0 level specifies that all the files in the / (root) file system be backed up. The -u flag causes the backup command to update the /etc/dumpdates  file for this backup. To back up all the files in the root (/) file system that have been modified since the last level 0 backup, type the following command:  backup  -1 -u -f /dev/rmt0 /  If the /etc/dumpdates file does not have an entry for a level 0 backup of the / (root) system, all the files in the file system are backed up. To back up virtual optical media files from the virtual media repository, complete the following tasks: Create a file called backup_files with the names of the files to be backed up.  Include the full path name. /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_file1 /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_file2 /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_filen Send the file using the backup command: cat backup_files | backup -i -f /dev/rmt0   Related Information The  command.

 backupios command Purpose Creates an installable image of the root volume group either onto a bootable tape, file system, or DVD.   Syntax backupios   {Directory} [] []  backupios   {File name} [] [ ] [] []  backupios   Device [] [ ] [] [] []  backupios   Device   { | } [] [] []   Description The backupios command creates a backup of the  and places it onto a file system, bootable tape, or DVD. You can use this backup to reinstall a system to its original state after it has been corrupted. If you create the backup on tape , the tape is bootable and includes the installation programs needed to install from the backup.   If the -cd flag is specified, the backupios command creates a system backup image to DVD-RAM media. If you need to create multi-volume discs because the image does not fit on one disc, the backupios command gives instructions for disk replacement and removal until all the volumes have been created.    Vendor disc drives may support burning to additional disc types, such as CD-RW and DVD-R. Refer to the documentation for your drive to determine which disc types are supported.  If the -file flag is specified, the backupios command creates a system backup image to the path specified. The file system must be mounted and writable by the  root user prior to running the backupios command (see  for details). Backing up the  to a remote file system will create the nim_resources.tar image in the directory you specify. The  must have root write access to the server on which the backup will be created. This backup can be reinstalled from the  using the installios command.  The backupios command empties the target_disks_stanza section of bosinst.data (which is part of the nim_resources.tar image) and sets RECOVER_DEVICES=Default. This allows the mksysb file generated by the command to be cloned to another logical partition.  If you plan to use the nim_resources.tar image to install to a specific disk, then you need to repopulate the target_disks_stanza section of bosinst.data and replace this file in the nim_resources.tar image. All other parts of the nim_resources.tar image must remain unchanged.  Prior to backing up the root volume group, the backupios command saves the structure of all user-defined volume groups by calling the savevgstruct command for each volume group defined. To avoid having all user-defined volume groups backed up, use the -nosvg flag.   The backupios command backs up only the volume group structures that are activated. The structures of volumes groups that are deactivated are not backed up.   Flags Flag name Description -accept Accepts licenses. -blocks Number Specifies the number of 512-byte blocks to write in a single output operation. Default is 100. Should be used with tape device only. -cd Specifies the cd device name on which the image is to be stored. -cdformat Creates final CD images that are DVD sized (up to 4.38 GB).  -file Specifies the directory on which the image is to be stored. Enter the complete directory pathname. Images are reinstalled using NIMOL. Note: When the -mksysb flag is used, the NIMOL resources are not saved in the image. With -mksysb option, specify filename. When the -mksysb flag is used, the NIMOL resources are not saved in the image. With -mksysb option, specify filename. -mksysb Creates an image without the NIMOL resources. -nomedialib  Prevents the contents of the media repository from being saved as part of the backupios process. -nopak When used with the -tape flag, the -nopak flag disables software packing of the files as they are backed up. Some tape drives use their own packing or compression algorithms. When used with the -file flag, the -nopak flag excludes files that are listed line by line in the /etc/exclude_packing.rootvg file from being packed. -nosvg Prevents the volume groups structure of user defined volume groups from being saved as part  of the backupios process. -tape Specifies the tape device name on which the image is to be stored. -udf Creates a UDF (Universal Disk Format) file system on DVD-RAM media. The default format is Rock Ridge (ISO9660). -verify Verifies a tape backup. This flag causes the  command to verify the file header of each file on the backup tape and report any read errors as they occur.   Exit Status See .   ExamplesTo generate a backup to the optical device named /dev/cd1, type: backupios -cd /dev/cd1 -cdformat To generate a system backup to a tape device named /dev/rmt0, type: backupios -tape /dev/rmt0   Related Information The  command and the  command.

 chdate command Purpose Displays or changes the date, time or time zone.   Syntax  [ mmddHHMM [YYyy | yy] ] [ TZ]     [ YYyy] [ mm] [ dd] [ HH] [ MM] [ TZ]    Description Displays or changes the system date, time, or time zone. Changes made to the time zone will not take effect until the user logs out. For the time zone to take effect for the entire system, the system must be rebooted. All flags are optional, and the current system time information will be used if a flag was unspecified.    If no flags or arguments are specified, the  command displays the current date and time.    The mmddHHMM [YYyy | yy]	parameters correspond to month, day, hour, minute, and optional 4 or 2 digit year.  If you do not specify the first 2 digits of the year, values in the range 70 - 99 refer to the twentieth century and values in the range 00 - 37 refer to the twenty-first century. If a 4-digit year is specified, the  command attempts to set the year to YYyy and fails for the values that are out of range (less than 1970 and greater than 2105). For years in the range 2038 - 2105, specify the year in the yyyy format.   The user must have padmin authority to change the date and time.   Flags Flag name Description -year Sets the year to YYyy. -month Sets the month to mm. -day Sets the day to dd. -hour Sets the hour to HH in 24-hour format. -minute Sets the minute to MM. -timezone Sets the time zone (for example, CST6CDT).

 fsck command Purpose Checks file system consistency and interactively repairs the file system.   Syntax fsck [ FileSystem ... ]   Description The fsck command checks and interactively repairs inconsistent file systems. Normally, the file system is consistent, and the fsck command merely reports on the number of files, used blocks, and free blocks in the file system. If the file system is inconsistent, the fsck command displays information about the inconsistencies found and prompts you for permission to repair them. If no FileSystem is specified, all file systems are checked.  The fsck command checks for the following inconsistencies: Blocks or fragments allocated to multiple files. inodes containing block or fragment numbers that overlap. inodes containing block or fragment numbers out of range. Discrepancies between the number of directory references to a file and the link count of the file. Illegally allocated blocks or fragments. inodes containing block or fragment numbers that are marked free in the disk map. inodes containing corrupt block or fragment numbers. A fragment that is not the last disk address in an inode. This check does not apply to compressed file systems. Files larger than 32KB containing a fragment. This check does not apply to compressed file systems. Size checks: Incorrect number of blocks. Directory size not a multiple of 512 bytes.   These checks do not apply to compressed file systems. Directory checks: Directory entry containing an inode number marked free in the inode map. inode number out of range. Dot (.) link missing or not pointing to itself. Dot dot (..) link missing or not pointing to the parent directory. Files that are not referenced or directories that are not reachable. Inconsistent disk map. Inconsistent inode map.  In addition to its messages, the fsck command records the outcome of its checks and repairs through its exit value. This exit value can be any sum of the following conditions: Value Description 0 All checked file systems are now okay. 2 The fsck command was interrupted before it could complete checks or repairs. 4 The fsck command changed the file system; the user must restart the system immediately. 8 The file system contains unrepaired damage.   Exit Status See .   Examples To check a file system, enter: fsck /dev/hd1 This command checks the unmounted file system located on the /dev/hd1 device.   Parent topic:  Parent topic:

 ldfware command Purpose Loads the system's flash EPROM with the specified file, which must contain a valid binary flash EPROM image, and then reboots the system.   Syntax ldfware [  Device ]  filename  ldfware  ldfware    Description Periodically, you need to install fixes for your server firmware. If  you do not use an  to manage your server, you must get your fixes through your operating system. If your server is not connected to the Internet, you must obtain optical media that contains the server firmware fix and install the server firmware fix from the optical media.  The flash update image file is copied to the file system from diskette. The user needs to provide the image on a diskette if the user does not have access to remote file systems or any other files that are on the system. If enough space is not available, an error is reported stating additional system memory is needed. After the file is copied, a warning screen asks for confirmation to continue the update flash. Continuing the update flash reboots the system. The current flash image is not saved.  After you download and install a firmware fix, the fix is temporarily installed until you install it permanently. You might want to use the new level of firmware for a period of time to verify that it works correctly. When you are sure that the new level of firmware works correctly, you can permanently install the firmware fix. Be aware that if you install the firmware fix permanently (copy the temporary firmware level from the temporary side to the permanent side, so that the temporary and permanent sides contain the same level of firmware), you cannot return to the level that was previously on the permanent side. To install it permanently, use the -commit flag.   The ldfware command reboots the entire system. Do not use this command if more than one user is signed onto the system.   Flags Flag name Description -commit Commits the temporary image when booted from the temporary image. This effectively causes the permanent image to be copied over by the temporary image. This flag is not supported on all systems. -dev Device Specifies that the flash update image file is on diskette. The device_name variable specifies the device. The default device_name is /dev/fd0. -file FileName Specifies the file name of the image file source. The flash update image file source follows this flag. The file_name variable specifies the fully qualified path of the flash update image file. -reject Rejects the temporary image when booted from the permanent image.  This overwrites the temporary image with the permanent image. This flag is not supported on all systems.   Exit Status The following exit codes are returned:  Value Description 0 Completed successfully. 1 Command terminated due to an error.      2 Command was aborted by the user. 3 Command was aborted by the user using the F10 key.   Examples To update the firmware from a local file, type the following command:     ldfware -file /tmp/firmware/latest_flash    To update the firmware that is on a diskette, type the following command:                ldfware -device /dev/fd0 -file latest_flash  To update the firmware that is on a CD device, type the following command: mount -cd  /mnt ldfware -file /mnt/firmware/latest_flash   Parent topic:  Parent topic:

 lsfware command Purpose Displays microcode and firmware levels of the system, adapters and devices.   Syntax lsfware [  |  Name ]   Description The lsfware command displays the platform system firmware microcode level and the service processor microcode levels, if supported. Not all systems contain a service processor, nor do all systems support displaying the system processor level. Information on a specific device is displayed with the -dev flag.   The -all flag displays system firmware/microcode for all devices.  The output from the -all flag is always delimiter separated.     Flags Flag name Description -all Displays microcode level information for all supported devices. -dev Name Displays microcode level information for the named device.   Examples To display the system firmware level and service processor (if present), type:   lsfware The system displays the following message: System Firmware level is TCP99256  To display the microcode level for all supported devices, type:  lsfware -all The system displays the following message: sys0|system:TCP99256  rmt0|C009  scraid0|adapter:4.20.18|adapter-boot:4.00.26  raid-dasd|22:FFC #:DDYS-T0.524D3031.53393446  raid-dasd|26:FFC #:DDYS-T0.524D3031.53393446  raid-dasd|2e:FFC #:DDYS-T0.525A3034.53393243  ....

Examples 	To display the logical partition number and name, type: 	lslparinfo  	 Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 motd command Purpose Displays or modifies the partition's message of the day file.   Syntax motd  [ |  ]  Filename  motd  [ |  ]  "Message of the day string"   Description The motd command writes or appends to the partitions message of the day file.  The new message can be specified on the command line or in a file with the -file flag.  If no flags are specified the current message of the day is displayed.   Flags Flag name Description -append Appends the specified message to the current message of the day -file FileName Replaces the current message of the day with the contents of FileName -overwrite Replaces the current message of the day with the specified message   Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 pdump command Purpose Perform platform (hardware and firmware) dump-related actions.   Syntax pdump { fstype  |  |  |  | }   Description The pdump command helps the operating system save firmware and hardware related dumps. This command also provides an estimate of the disk space required for storing these dumps. Note that platform and scan dumps are saved in order to capture the state of the firmware and the hardware for analysis.   Flags Flag name Description -disable Disables platform dumps. -enable Enables platform dumps. -ls Lists the current configuration of platform dump. -reserve fstype Reserves enough disk space on the system for platform dumps. The -enable option will create a file system (if one does not exist) exclusively for platform dumps. If a file system already exists and the size is not enough, the file system size will be increased. The fstype must be a valid file system type. If the file system already exists, any may be specified. -size Provides an estimate of disk space required to save the platform dumps when they occur. This option will interact with the firmware to provide this estimate. It is expected that, based on this space information, the user will have enough disk space allocated for platform dumps to be saved. The value output will be the required size in bytes.

 restore command Purpose Extracts files from archives created with the backup command.   Syntax To restore files archived by file name:  restore -x [ d M n Q v q e ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] [ -E { force | ignore | warn } ] [ File ... ]  To list files archived by file name:  restore -T | -t [a l n q v Q ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ]  To restore files archived by file system:  restore -r [ B n q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f  Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] restore -R [ B n v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] restore -i [ h m n q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] restore -x [ B h n m q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] [ File ... ]  To restore files beginning at a specified volume number:   restore -X Number [ -Md n q v e Q ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s Number ] [ -E { force | ignore | warn } ] [ File ... ]  To list files archived by file system:  restore -t | -T [ B a l n h q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] [ File ... ]  To restore file attributes archived by file name:  restore -Pstring [B d q v Q ] [ b Number] [ s SeekNumber ] [-f Device ] [ File ... ]  To restore file attributes archived by file system:  restore -Pstring [ h q v] [ b Number] [ s SeekNumber ] [-f Device] [ File ... ]   Description The restore command reads archives created by the backup operation and extracts the files stored on them. These archives can be in either file name or file system format. An archive can be stored on disk, diskette, or tape. Files must be restored using the same method by which they were archived. This requires that you know the format of the archive. The archive format can be determined by examining the archive volume header information that is displayed when using the -T flag. When using the -x, -r, -T, or -t flags, the restore command automatically determines the archive format.    The restore command determines the actively sparses files that are being restored. If a file has block aligned and sized areas that are NULL populated, then the restore command does not cause physical space for those file system blocks to be allocated. The size in bytes of the file remain the same, but the actual space taken within the file system is only for the non-NULL areas.  Individual files can be restored from either file name or file system archives by using the -x flag and specifying the file name. The file name must be specified as it exists on the archive. Files can be restored interactively from file system archives using the -i flag. The names of the files on an archive can be written to standard output using the -T flag.   Users must have write access to the file system device or have restore authorization in order to extract the contents of the archive.   The diskette device, /dev/rfd0, is the default media for the restore command. To restore from standard input, specify a dash (-) with the -f flag. You can also specify a range of devices, such as /dev/rmt0-2.    If you are restoring from a multiple-volume archive, the restore command reads the volume mounted, prompts you for the next volume, and waits for your response. After inserting the next volume, press the Enter key to continue restoring files.  If an archive was created using the backup command and was made to a tape device with the device block size set to 0, it might be necessary for you to have explicit knowledge of the block size that was used when the tape was created to restore from the tape.  Multiple archives can exist on a single tape. When you are restoring multiple archives from tape, the restore command expects the input device to be a no-retension-on-open, no-rewind-on-close tape device. Do not use a no-rewind tape device for restoring unless the -B, -s, or -X flag is specified.    File system archives  File system archives are also known as i-node archives due to the method used to archive the files. A file system name is specified with the backup command, and the files within that file system are archived based on their structure and layout within the file system. The restore command restores the files on a file system archive without any special understanding of the underlying structure of the file system.   When restoring file system archives, the restore command creates and uses a file named restoresymtable. This file is created in the current directory. The file is necessary for the restore command to do incremental file system restore operation.   Do not remove the restoresymtable file if you perform incremental file system backups and restores.  The File parameter is ignored when using either the -r or the -R flag.  File-name archives  File-name archives are created by specifying a list of file names to archive by using the backup command. The restore operation restores the files from a file name archive without any special understanding of the underlying structure of the file system. The restore operation allows for metacharacters to be used when specifying files for archive extraction. This provides the capability to extract files from an archive based on pattern matching. A pattern file name should be enclosed in single quotations, and patterns should be enclosed in parentheses (...).  About sparse files  File system files for the operating system that contain long strings of NULLs can be stored much more efficiently than other files. To be specific, if a string of NULLs spans an entire allocation block, that whole block is not stored on disk at all. Files where one or more blocks are omitted in this way are called sparse files. The missing blocks are also known as holes.   Sparse files are not the same as compressed files. Sparse files are exactly the same as their nonsparse equivalents when they are read.  Sparse files are generally created by database applications. Whenever a database file is created, it is formatted with NULLs. These fragments might be either filled with allocated or deallocated NULLs.   Flags Flag name Description -a Displays the -a option displays the list of files in the archive, along with their permissions when specified with the -t or -T flag. -B Specifies that the archive should be read from standard input. Normally, the restore operation examines the actual medium to determine the backup format. When using a |  (pipe), this examination cannot occur. As a result, the archive is assumed to be in file system format, and the device is assumed to be standard input (-f -). -b Number  For backups done by name, specifies the number of 512-byte blocks. For backups done by i-node, specifies the number of 1024-byte blocks to read in a single output operation. When the restore operation reads from tape devices, the default is 100 for backups by name and 32 for backups by i-node.   The read size is the number of blocks multiplied by the block size. The default read size for the restore operation reading from tape devices is 51200 (100 Ã 512) for backups by name and 32768 (32 Ã 1024) for backups by i-node. The read size must be an even multiple of the tape's physical block size. If the read size is not an even multiple of the tape's physical block size and it is in fixed block mode (nonzero), the restore command tries to determine a valid value for Number. If successful, the restore operation changes Number to the new value, writes a message about the change to standard output, and continues. If unsuccessful in finding a valid value for Number, the restore operation writes an error message to standard error and exits with a nonzero return code. Larger values for the Number parameter result in larger physical transfers from the tape device.   The value of the -b flag is always ignored when the restore command reads from diskette. In this case, the command always reads in clusters that occupy a complete track. -d Indicates that, if the File parameter is a directory, all files in that directory should be restored. This flag can only be used when the archive is in file name format. -e  Restores the nonsparse files because they were archived by the name format of the backup operation for both packed and unpacked files. It is necessary to know the sparseness or nonsparseness of the files before archiving the files, since enabling this flag restores the sparse files as nonsparse.    This flag should be enabled only if the files being restored are nonsparsed, consisting of more than 4K NULLs. If the -e flag is specified during the restore opeation, it successfully restores all normal files normally and nonsparse database files as nonsparse. -E  Extracts beginning at a specified volume number and requires one of the following arguments. If you omit the -E flag, warn is the default behavior.  force Fails the restore operation on a file if the fixed extent size or space reservation of the file cannot be preserved. ignore Ignores any errors in preserving extent attributes. warn Issues a warning if the space reservation or the fixed size of the file cannot be preserved.  -f Device  Specifies the input device. To receive input from a named device, specify the Device variable as a path name (such as /dev/rmt0). To receive input from the standard output device, specify a dash (-)   You can also specify a range of archive devices. The range specification must be in the following format:  /dev/deviceXXX-YYY where XXX and YYY are whole numbers, and XXX must always be less than YYY; for example:  /dev/rfd0-3  All devices in the specified range must be of the same type. For example, you can use a set of 8 mm, 2.3 GB tapes or a set of 1.44 MB diskettes. All tape devices must be set to the same physical tape block size.  If the Device  variable specifies a range, the restore operation automatically goes from one device in the range to the next. After exhausting all of the specified devices, the restore operation halts and requests that new volumes be mounted on the range of devices. -h Restores only the actual directory, not the files contained in it. This flag can only be used when the archive is in file system format. This flag is ignored when used with the -r or -R flag. -i Allows you to interactively restore selected files from a file system archive. The subcommands for the -i  flag are: add [File]: Specifies that the File parameter is added to the list of files to extract.  If File is a directory, that directory and all the  files contained in it are added to the extraction list (unless the -h flag is used). If File is not specified,  the current directory is added to the extraction list.  cd Directory:  Changes the current directory to the specified directory.  delete [File]:  Specifies that  the File parameter is to be removed from the list of  files to be extracted. If File is a directory, that directory  and all the files contained in it are removed from the extraction list (unless the  -h flag is used).  extract:  Restores all the directories and files on the extraction list.   help:  Displays a summary of the subcommands.    ls [Directory]:  Displays the directories and files contained within the Directory parameter. Directory names are displayed with a slash (/) after the name. Files and directories, within the specified directory, that are on the extraction list are displayed with an asterick (*) before the name. If verbose mode is on, the  i-node number of the files and directories is also displayed. If the Directory parameter is not specified, the current directory is used .  pwd:  Displays the full path name of the current directory.   quit:  Causes the restore operation to exit immediately. Any files on the extraction list are not restored.  setmodes:  Sets the owner, mode, and time for all directories added to the extraction list.  verbose:  Causes the ls subcommand to display the i-node number of files and directories.  Additional information about each file is also displayed as it is extracted from the archive.    -l Displays a detailed list of files, which includes the time stamp, file permissions, file size, owner, and group  when specified with the -t or -T flag.. The -l option overrides the -a option. -M Sets the access and modification times of restored files to the time of restoration. You can specify the -M flag only when you are restoring individually named files and only if the -x or -X flags are also specified. When the -M flag is not specified, the restore operation maintains the access and modification times as they appear on the backup medium. -m Renames restored files to the file's i-node number as it exists on the archive. This is useful if a few files are being restored and you want these files restored under a different file name. Since any restored archive members are renamed to their i-node numbers, directory hierarchies and links are not preserved. Directories and hard links are restored as regular files. The -m flag is used when the archive is in file system format. -n By default the restore operation restores any Access Control List (ACL)s, Printing Color Files (PCL)s, or named extended attributes in the archive. The -n flag causes the restore operation to skip over any ACLs, PCLs, or named extended attributes in the archive and not restore them. -Pstring Restore only the file attributes. This flag does not restore the file contents. If the file specified does not exist in the target directory path, the file is not created. This flag restores file attributes selectively depending on the flags specified in the string parameter. The String parameter can be a combination of the following characters:  A Restore all attributes.  a Restore only the permissions of the files. o Restore only the ownership of the files. t Restore only the time stamp of the files. c Restore only the ACL attributes of the files   Among the existing flags for the restore command, flags v, h, b, s, f, B, d, and q are valid with the P flag. The P flag can be used with both file name and file system archives. If the File parameter is a symbolic link, then the metadata of the target file is modified and not that of the symbolic link.   Usage of -P flag overwrites the attributes of files owned by another user when run by the superuser. -Q For backups done by name, specifies that the command should exit upon encountering any type of error rather than attempt to recover and continue processing the archive. -q Specifies that the first volume is ready to use and that the restore operation should not prompt you to mount the volume and press Enter. If the archive spans multiple volumes, the restore command prompts you for the subsequent volumes. -r Restores all files in a file system archive. The -r flag is only used to restore complete level 0 backups or to restore incremental backups after a level 0 backup is restored. The restoresymtable file is used by the restore operation to pass information between incremental restore operations. This file should be removed after the last incremental backup is restored. The File parameter is ignored when using the -r flag. -R Requests a specific volume of a multiple-volume, file system archive. The -R flag allows a previously interrupted restore operation to be restarted. The File parameter is ignored when using the -R flag. Once restarted, the restore command behavior is the same as with the -r flag. -s SeekBackup Specifies the backup to seek and restore on a multiple-backup tape archive. The -s flag is only applicable when the archive is written to a tape device. To use the -s flag properly, a no-rewind-on-close and no-retension-on-open tape device, such as /dev/rmt0.1 or /dev/rmt0.5, must be specified. If the -s flag is specified with a rewind tape device, the restore command displays an error message and exits with a nonzero return code. If a no-rewind tape device is used and the -s flag is not specified, a default value of -s 1 is used. The value of the SeekBackup parameter must be in the range of 1 to 100 inclusive. It is necessary to use a no-rewind-on-close, no-retension-on-open tape device because of the behavior of the -s flag. The value specified with -s is relative to the position of the tape's read/write head and not to an archive's position on the tape. For example, to restore the first, second, and fourth backups from a multiple-backup tape archive, the respective values for the -s flag would be -s 1, -s 1, and -s 2. -t Displays information about the backup archive. If the archive is in file system format, a list of files found on the archive is written to standard output. The name of each file is preceded by the i-node number of the file as it exists on the archive. The file names displayed are relative to the root (/) directory of the file system that was backed up. If the File parameter is not specified, all the files on the archive are listed. If the File parameter is used, then just that file is listed. If the File parameter refers to a directory, all the files contained in that directory are listed. If the archive is in file name format, information contained in the volume header is written to standard error. This flag can be used to determine if the archive is in file name or file system format. -T Displays information about the backup archive. If the archive is in file name format, the information contained in the volume header is written to standard error, and a list of files found on the archive is written to standard output. The File parameter is ignored for file name archives. If the archive is in file system format, the behavior is identical to the -t flag. -v Displays additional information when restoring. If the archive is in file name format and either the -x or -T flag is specified, the size of the file as it exists on the archive is displayed in bytes. Directory, block, or character device files are archived with a size of 0. Symbolic links are listed with the size of the symbolic link. Hard links are listed with the size of the file, which is how they are archived. Once the archive is read, a total of these sizes is displayed. If the archive is in file system format, directory and nondirectory archive members are distinguished. -x  Restores individually named files specified by the File parameter. If the File parameter is not specified, all the archive members are restored. If the File parameter is a directory and the archive is in file name format, only the directory is restored. If the File parameter is a directory and the archive is in file system format, all the files contained in the directory are restored. The file names specified by the File parameter must be the same as the names shown by the restore -T flag. Files are restored with the same name they were archived with. If the file name was archived using a relative path name (./filename), the file is restored relative to the current directory. If the archive is in file system format, files are restored relative to the current directory.  The restore command automatically creates any needed directories. When using this flag to restore file system backups, you are prompted to enter the beginning volume number.  The restore command allows for shell-style pattern matching metacharacters to be used when specifying files for archive extraction. The rules for matching metacharacters are the same as those used in shell pathname "globbing," namely:  asterick* (* ) Matches zero or more characters, but not a . (period) or / (slash). question mark (?) Matches any single character, but not a . (period) or / (slash). brackets ([ ]) Matches any one of the characters enclosed within the brackets. If a pair of characters separated by a dash are contained within the brackets, the pattern matches any character that lexically falls between the two characters in the current local. Additionally, a . (period) or a / (slash) within the brackets will not match a . (period) or a /  (slash) in a file name.  backslash (\) Matches the immediately following character, preventing its possible interpretation as a metacharacter. -X VolumeNumber Begins restoring from the specified volume of a multiple-volume, file name backup. Once started, the restore command behavior is the same as with the -x flag. The -X flag applies only to file name archives.  -y Continues restoring when tape errors are encountered. Normally, the restore command asks you whether or not to continue. In either case, all data in the read buffer is replaced with zeros. The -y flag applies only when the archive is in file system format. ? Displays a usage message.   Exit Status This command returns the following exit values:  Return code Description 0   Successful completion. >0   An error occurred.   Examples To list the names of files in either a file name or file system archive on diskette device /dev/rfd0, type the following command:   restore -Tq  The archive is read from the /dev/rfd0 default restore device. The names of all the files and directories contained in the archive are displayed. For file system archives, the file name is preceded by the i-node number of the file as it exists on the archive. The -q flag tells the restore command that the first volume is available and is ready to be read. As a result, you are not prompted to mount the first volume. To restore a specific file, type the following command:   restore -xvqf myhome.bkup system.data  This command extracts the file system.data into the current directory from the archive myhome.bkup. The archive in this example is in the current directory. File and directory names must be specified as they are displayed when using the -T flag. The -v flag displays additional information during the extraction. This example applies to both file name and file system archives. To restore a specific file from tape into the virtual media repository, type the following command:  restore -xvqf /dev/rmt0 /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_file To restore a specific directory and the contents of that directory from a file name archive, type the following command:  restore -xdvqf /dev/rmt0 /home/mike/tools  The -x flag extracts files by their file name. The -d flag tells the restore command to extract all the files and subdirectories in the /home/mike/tools directory. File and directory names must be specified as they are displayed when using the -T flag. If the directories do not exist, they are created. To restore a specific directory and the contents of that directory from a file system archive, type the following command:   restore -xvqf /dev/rmt0 /home/mike/tools  This command extracts files by file name. File and directory names must be specified as they are displayed when using the -T flag. If the directories do not exist, they are created. To restore an entire file system archive, type the following command:   restore -rvqf /dev/rmt0  This command restores the entire file system archived on tape device /dev/rmt0 the current directory. This example assumes you are in the root directory of the file system to be restored. If the archive is part of a set of incremental file system archives, the archives should be restored in increasing backup-level order beginning with level 0 (for example, 0, 1, 2). To restore the fifth and ninth backups from a single-volume, multiple-backup tape, type the following command:  restore -xvqs 5 -f/dev/rmt0.1  restore -xvqs 4 -f/dev/rmt0.1 The first command extracts all files from the fifth archive on the multiple-backup tape specified by /dev/rmt0.1. The .1 designator specifies that the tape device will not be retensioned when it is opened and that it will not be rewound when it is closed. It is necessary to use a no-rewind-on-close, no-retension-on-open tape device because of the behavior of the -s flag. The second command extracts all the files from the fourth archive (relative to the current location of the tape head on the tape). After the fifth archive has been restored, the tape read/write head is in a position to read the archive. Since you want to extract the ninth archive on the tape, you must specify a value of 4 with the -s flag. This is because the -s flag is relative to your position on the tape and not to an archive's position on the tape. The ninth archive is the fourth archive from your current position on the tape. To restore the fourth backup, which begins on the sixth tape on a 10-tape multiple-backup archive, put the sixth tape into the tape drive and type the following command:   restore -xcs 2 -f /dev/rmt0.1 /home/mike/manual/chap3  Assuming the fourth backup is the second backup on the sixth tape, specifying -s 2 advances the tape head to the beginning of the second backup on this tape. The restore command then restores the specified file from the archive. If the backup continues onto subsequent volumes and the file has not been restored, the restore command instructs you to insert the next volume until the end of the backup is reached. The -f flag specifies the no-rewind, no-retension tape device name.    The -s flag specifies the backup number relative to the tape inserted in the tape drive, not to the overall 10-tape archive. To improve the performance on streaming tape devices, pipe the dd command to the restore command and type the following command:   dd if=/dev/rmt0 bs=64b | restore -xf- -b64  The dd command reads the archive from the tape using a block size of 64 512-byte blocks and writes the archive to standard output. The restore command reads the standard input using a block size of 64 512-byte blocks. The value of the block size used by the dd command to read the archive from the tape must be an even multiple of the block size that was used to create the tape with the backup command. For example, the following backup command could be used to create the archive that this example extracts:   find /home -print | backup -ivqf/dev/rmt0 -b64  This example applies to archives in file name format only. If the archive was in file system format, the restore command should include the -B flag. To improve the performance of the restore command on 9348 Magnetic Tape Unit Model 12, you can change the block size by typing the following command:   chdev -l DeviceName -a BlockSize=32k To restore nonsparse database files, type the following command:   restore  -xef  /dev/rmt0 To restore files that were archived as sparse, type the following command:  restore  -xf  /dev/rmt0 To restore only the permissions of the files from the archive, type the following command:  restore -Pa -vf /dev/rmt0 To restore only the ACL attributes of the files from the archive, type the following command:    restore -Pc -vf /dev/rmt0 To view the table of contents along with the file permissions, type the following command:   restore -Ta -vf /dev/rmt0 To view the table of contents of a file name archive along with the time stamps and file permissions, type the following command:   restore -Tl -vf /dev/rmt0 To view the table of contents of a file system archive along with the time stamps and file permissions, type the following command:   restore -tl -vf /dev/rmt0   Related Information The  command.

 restorevgstruct command Purpose Restores the user volume group.   Syntax restorevgstruct { -ls | -vg VolumeGroupLabel  [ DiskName ... ] }   Description The restorevgstruct command restores the structure of a previously saved user volume group.  If the -ls flag is specified, a list of previously-saved volume groups and the date each volume group was saved is displayed.  This command does not work on rootvg.   Flags Flag name Description DiskName... Specifies the names of disk devices to be used instead of the 	disk devices saved in the volume group structure. Target disk devices must be defined as empty physical volumes; that is, they must contain a physical volume identifier and must not belong to a volume group. If the target disk devices belong to a volume group, they must be removed from the volume group using the reducevg command.  -ls Displays a list of previously saved volume groups. -vg Specifies the name of the VolumeGroup to restore.    Exit Status See .   Examples To restore the volume group myvg, onto the hdisk2 and hdisk3 disks, enter: restorevgstruct myvg hdisk2 hdisk3   To list all previously saved volume groups, enter: restorvgstruct -ls The message generated would be similar to:  -rw-r--r--   1 root     system        51200 Jun 18 10:53 myvg.data -rw-r--r--   1 root     system        51200 Jun 18 10:53 myvg2.data   Related Information The  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, and the  command.

 svmon command Purpose Captures and analyzes a snapshot of virtual memory. Syntax   svmon   [   ] [   ] [   [  ] ] [  [  |  ] ]    svmon   [ -O  ] [ -i  [  ] ]    svmon  [ -O  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]     svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -a  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [   ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -c <  > ] [ -O  ] Description The svmon command displays information about the current state of memory. The displayed information does not constitute a true snapshot of memory, however, because the svmon command runs at user level with interrupts enabled.  If you specify no flag, the svmon command, by default, reports real memory at the system level.   You can see memory consumption details and generate the following types of reports. To see more information about a type of report, select one of the following links:   The output of these reports can be in compact format or long format. To generate compact format report, specify the -O flag. If you do not specify the -O flag, the report is in long format. Command report The command report displays the statistics of memory use for the specified command. To print this report, specify the -C flag. The command report can be in compact format or in long format: Item Description Compact report A one line summary for each command. To set compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines report for each command that contains a summary, a size-per-page report, and the details of the segments. To set long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. Detailed segment report The detailed segment report displays detailed information about the primary segments that are specified. To print the detailed segment report, specify the -D flag.   The detailed segment report is in long report format only.  Global report The global report displays the statistics of the real memory and paging space that are in use for the whole system. If you do not specify any flag, the global report is the default format of report that the svmon command generates.  To print the global report, specify the -G flag.   The global report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A report on only the main metrics of the system. This report is one line with a maximum of 160 characters. Long report A summary of memory, page size, and affinity domain. The report is multiple lines, which is the default format of global report.  By default, the following metrics are displayed:  The memory metric displays the memory consumption of the machine. The Page Size metric displays the memory consumption of the Page Size. The Affinity Domain metric reports the memory affinity by affinity domain. Process report The process report displays the memory use for the specified active process. If you do not specify a list of processes, the svmon command displays the memory use statistics for all active processes.  To print the process report, specify the -P flag.  The process report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A one line report for each process. To set the compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines summary for each process. To set the long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. This report contains a summary for each process, a per-page-size report, and the details of the segments.  The svmon command does not show the decrease in the memory usage count when the application releases the memory. When the memory is released from the application, it goes back to the memory free list of the per-process. The svmon command accounts for the memory that is released as the allocated memory for that application. Segment report The segment report displays the statistics of memory use for the specified segments. To display the statistics for all of the defined segments, do not specify any list.   To print the segment report, specify the -S flag.   The segment report includes metrics for each specified segment. The report contains several lines of metrics for each segment. User report The user report displays the statistics of memory use for the specified users (login names). To display the statistics for all of the users, do not specify any list of login names.   To print the user report, specify the -U flag.   The user report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A one line report for each user. To set the compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines summary for each user. To set the long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. This report contains a summary for each user, a per-page-size report, and the details of the segments. Workload management class report The workload management class report displays statistics of memory use for the specified workload management classes. To display the statistics for all of the defined classes, do not specify any class.   To print the workload management class report, specify the -W flag.  Restriction: This report is available only when the  is running. If the  is not running, the following message is displayed and no statistics are reported:  WLM must be started If the  is running in passive mode, the svmon command displays the following message before displaying the statistics:  WLM is running in passive mode  The workload management class report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A one line report for each class. To set the compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines summary for each class. To set the long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. This report contains a summary for each class, a per-page size report, and the details of the segments. Workload management tier report The workload management tier report displays information about the tiers, such as the tier number, the superclass name, and the total number of pages in real memory from segments belonging to the tier.  To print the tier report, specify the -T flag. Only the long report format is supported.  Restriction: This report is available only when the  is running. If the  is not running, the following message is displayed and no statistics are reported:  WLM must be started If the  is running in passive mode, the svmon command displays the following message before displaying the statistics:  WLM is running in passive mode XML report You can use the svmon command with an -X flag to generate a report in XML format. The XML report contains data of the global environment, the processes, the segments, the users, the workload management classes, and the commands running on the system.  The report is by default printed to the standard output. To print the output to a file named , specify the -O  flag. The extension of the output file will be .svm.  The .svm file uses an XML Schema Definition (XSD) that the /usr/lib/perf/svmon_schema.xsd file defines. You can use the XML data in the XML reports to build custom applications because the schema is self-documented.  In the XML report, if you do not specify the -O affinity argument, or set it to the off value, only the domain affinity at system level is reported. Flags If no command line flag is given, then the -G flag is the default.   Item Description  [ ALL |  ]  Displays report for the .   The -@ ALL option specifies to display the report for all of the s starting with the global report, and to process all of the available s, sorting them by the  name.  When you specify a list of  names in the  parameter, the  information is displayed in a header, and the report is displayed without adding  information. All information displayed is restricted to the  that was processed and has meaning only inside the . For example, the  displayed is virtual , which is the  inside the . The same rule applies to the  options. Each  name in the list is processed in the given order and each  report is separated by the  header.  When you do not specify a list, the command adds  information to existing reports. The pid section and segments section of the report contain the  name when one is available. Virtual  information might also be displayed.  When all of the keywords are used, the  command processes all of the available s, sorting them by the  name.   The -@ flag is not supported when executed within a . -a  Restricts the scope to the subclasses of the supclassname parameter (in the Tier report that is returned with the -T flag).  -c <  > Adds a comment, specified by the  parameter, into the XML report. Use the -c flag with the -X flag.  -C  Displays memory use statistics for the processes running the commands that are specified by the commands parameter. -D  Displays memory use statistics for the segments that the sids parameter specifies, and a detail status of all of the frames of each segment. -G Displays a global report. -i  [  ] Displays statistics repetitively.  The svmon command collects and prints statistics in the interval that the interval parameter specifies.   The numintervals parameter specifies the number of repetitions. If the parameter is not specified, the svmon command runs until you interrupt it (Ctrl+C).

Busy% Indicates the percentage of time the physical disk was active (bandwidth utilization for the drive). KBPS The number of kilobytes read and written per second over the monitoring interval. This field is the sum of KB-Read and KB-Read. TPS The number of transfers per second that were issued to the physical disk. A transfer is an I/O request to the physical disk. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the disk. A transfer is of indeterminate size. KB-Read The number of kilobytes read per second from the physical disk. K -Writ The number of kilobytes written per second to the physical disk.  When this subsection first displays the list of hot physical disks, the list is sorted by the KBPS field. However, the list can be sorted by the other fields by moving the cursor to the top of the desired column. Sorting is only valid for up to 128 physical disks. WLM Classes  This subsection displays a list of hot WorkLoad Management (WLM) Classes. The maximum number of WLM classes displayed is the number of hot WLM classes being monitored as specified with the -wlmdisp flag. A smaller number of classes will be displayed if other subsections  are also being displayed. Pressing the w key turns off this subsection. The following fields are displayed for each class:   % CPU Utilization The average CPU utilization of the WLM class over the monitoring interval. % Mem Utilization The average memory utilization of the WLM class over the monitoring interval. % Blk I/O The average percent of Block I/O of the WLM class over the monitoring interval.  When this subsection first displays the list of hot WLM classes, the list will be sorted by the CPU% field. However, the list can be sorted by the other fields by moving the cursor to the top of the desired column.  Processes This subsection displays a list of hot processes. The maximum number of processes displayed is the number of hot processes being monitored as specified with the -procs flag. A smaller number of processes will be displayed if other subsections are also being displayed. Pressing the p key turns off this subsection. The process are sorted by their CPU usage over the monitoring interval. The following fields are displayed for each process:  Name The name of the executable program executing in the process. The name is stripped of any pathname and argument information and truncated to 9 characters in length. Process ID The process ID of the process. % CPU Utilization The average CPU utilization of the process over the monitoring interval. The first time a process is shown, this value is the average CPU utilization over the lifetime of the process. Paging Space Used The size of the paging space allocated to this process. This can be considered an expression of the footprint of the process but does not include the memory used to keep the executable program and any shared libraries it may depend on. Process Owner (if the WLM section is off) The user name of the user who owns the process. WorkLoad Management (WLM) Class (if the WLM section is on) The WLM class to which the process belongs.     Implementation Specifics Changes to WLM that are shown by topas (like adding new classes, or changing existing class names) will not be reflected after starting topas. You must stop topas and all clients which use Spmi, then restart after the WLM changes are made. This is also the case for Disks and Network Adapters added after topas or any other Spmi consumer is started.   Sample Default Output The following is an example of the display generated by the topas command:   Topas Monitor for host:    niller               EVENTS/QUEUES    FILE/TTY Mon Mar 13 15:56:32 2000   Interval:  2         Cswitch     113  Readch  1853576                                                 Syscall    2510  Writech   49883 CPU   User%   Kern%  Wait%  Idle%               Reads       466  Rawin         0 cpu0    7.0     4.0    0.0   89.0               Writes       12  Ttyout      706 cpu1    1.0     8.0    0.0   91.0               Forks         0  Igets         0 cpu2    0.0     0.0    0.0  100.0               Execs         0  Namei         0                                                 Runqueue    0.0  Dirblk        0                                                 Waitqueue   0.0 Interf   KBPS   I-Pack  O-Pack   KB-In  KB-Out lo0      100.4    45.7    45.7    50.2    50.2  PAGING           MEMORY tr0        2.0     4.4     3.4     1.4     0.6  Faults        1  Real,MB    1024                                                 Steals        0  % Comp     81.0 Disk    Busy%     KBPS     TPS KB-Read KB-Writ  PgspIn        0  % Noncomp  19.0 hdisk0    0.0      0.0     0.0     0.0     0.0  PgspOut       0  % Client    3.0 hdisk1    0.0      0.0     0.0     0.0     0.0  PageIn        0                                                 PageOut       0  PAGING SPACE WLM-Class (Active)  CPU%    Mem%     Disk%      Sios          0  Size,MB       0 System               8      41        12                        % Used Shared               1      24         9                        % Free                                                 NFS      calls/sec Name     PID      CPU%   PgSP  Class            ServerV2    0   Press: topas    (35242)  3.0    0.3   System           ClientV2    0   "h" for help.

This is also the maximum number of CPUs displayed when enough room is available on the screen. If this number exceeds the number of CPUs available, only the installed CPUs will be monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no CPU information is monitored.When you specify a single flag, the topas command will take that value and the other values will be the default values. This is applicable to all the flags. -disks Specifies the number of disks to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of disks displayed when enough room is available on the screen. When this number exceeds the number of disks installed, only the installed disks are monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no disk information is monitored. -interval  Sets the monitoring interval in seconds. The default is 2 seconds. -nets Specifies the number of hot network interfaces to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of network interfaces displayed when enough room is available on the screen. When this number exceeds the number of network interfaces installed, only the installed network interfaces will be monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no network information is monitored. -procsdisp  Displays the full-screen process display. This display shows a list of the busiest processes, similar to the process subsection on the default display, only with more columns showing more metrics per process. This list can be sorted by any column. -procs Specifies the number of hot processes to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of processes shown when enough room is available on the screen. If this argument is omitted, a default of 20 is assumed. If a value of 0 is specified, no process information will be monitored. Retrieval of process information constitutes the majority of the topas overhead. If process information is not required, always use this option to specify that you do not want process information. -wlmdisp Displays the full-screen WLM class display, which is a split display. The top part of the display shows a list of hot WLM classes, similar to the WLM classes subsection on the default display, but with enough space available to display the full class names. This list can be sorted on any column. The bottom part of the display shows a list of busiest processes, similar to the full screen process display, but only displays processes belonging to one WLM class (selected with the f key). -wlms Specifies the number of hot WorkLoad Management (WLM) classes to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of WLM classes displayed when enough room is available on the screen. If this number exceeds the number of WLM classes installed, only the installed WLM classes will be monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no WLM class information is monitored. -filesys Specifies the number of file systems to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of file systems displayed when enough room is available. When this number exceeds the number of file systems mounted, only the mounted file systems are monitored and displayed. If you do not specify the -filesys flag, the default value is 2. If you specify a value of 0, the file system information is monitored. -tape Switches the tape display section between on and off in the main topas display. -fullscreen Specifies the full-screen display of the specified parameter. The following parameters can be specified: process, WLM, lpar, disk, net, CEC, vg, filesys, or tape. This list can be sorted by any column.process Displays the full screen Process screen. This display shows a list of the busiest processes. This is similar to the process subsection on the default panel, only with more columns showing more metrics per process. WLM Displays the full screen WLM Classes panel. The top part of the screen shows a list of hot WLM classes. This is similar to the WLM classes subsection on the default screen, but with enough space available to display the full class names. lpar Displays the full screen Logical Partition panel. In shared-memory mode, this screen displays information about I/O memory entitlement of the partition. disk Displays the full screen Disk Metrics panel (Disk Panel View). The screen reports disk service times, disk queuing metrics, and disk throughput. net Displays the full screen statistics for the shared Ethernet adapter on a Virtual I/O Server.  CEC Displays the Cross-partition Panel.  	Dedicated and shared partitions are displayed, and a set of aggregated values provide an overview of the entire hardware systems partition set. Certain values that are only available from the HMC platform can be set through the HMC console. vg Displays the Volume Group Panel. The panel reports the following metrics of the volume groups in the top section of the screen, and the same metrics of the logical volumes in the bottom section of the screen. filesys Displays full file system information. The screen reports file system service times, file system queuing metrics, and file system throughput. tape Displays the full screen tape screen. This reports bandwidth use of the tape device, the amount of data transferred (read or written) to the tape device, and the average number of transfers per second issued to the tape device.   Subcommands While topas is running, it accepts one-character subcommands. Each time the monitoring interval elapses, the program checks for one of the following subcommands and responds to the action requested.    Command Description a The a key shows all of the variable subsections being monitored (CPU, network, disk, WLM, and process). Pressing the a key always returns the topas command to the initial main display. c The c key toggles the CPU subsection between the cumulative report, off, and a list of the busiest CPUs. The number of busiest CPUs displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. d The d key toggles the disk subsection between a list of busiest disks, off, and the report on the total disk activity of the system. The number of busiest disks displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. h Show the help screen. n The n key toggles the network interfaces subsection between a list of busiest interfaces, off, and the report on the total network activity of the system. The number of busiest interfaces displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. w The w key toggles the WorkLoad Management (WLM) classes subsection on and off. The number of busiest WLM classes displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. p The p key toggles the hot processes subsection on and off. The number of busiest processes displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. P The uppercase P key replaces the default display with the full-screen process display. This display provides more detailed information about processes running on the system than the process section of the main display. When the P key is pressed again, it toggles back to the default main display. W The uppercase W key replaces the default display with the full-screen WLM class display. This display provides more detailed information about WLM classes and processes assigned to classes. When the W key is pressed again, it toggles back to the default main display. L The uppercase L key replaces the current display with the logical partition display. f Moving the cursor over a WLM class and pressing the f key displays the list of top processes in the class at the bottom of the WLM screen. This key is valid only when topas is in the full-screen WLM display (by using the W key or the -wlms flag). q Quit the program. r Refresh the display. Arrow and Tab keys Subsections from the main display such as the CPU, Network, Disk, WLM Classes, and the full-screen WLM and Process displays can be sorted by different criteria. Positioning the cursor over a column activates sorting on that column. The entries are always sorted from highest to lowest value. The cursor can be moved by using the Tab key or the arrow keys. Sorting is only valid for 128 disks and 16 network adapters.   Exit Status See .

 topasrec command Purpose Generates a binary recording of local system statistics, central electronics process (CEC) statistics, and cluster statistics.   Syntax topasrec { -local [ -trace trace_level] | -cec | -cluster} [ -count sample_count] [ -interval seconds] [ -out filename ]   Description The topasrec command records the local system data and the cross-partition data (CEC statistics) in binary format.  The command collects dedicated and shared logical partition data, as well as a set of aggregated values to provide an overview of the partition set on the same CEC.  When you run the command to record cluster statistics, the command collects a set of metrics for the list of hosts that are specified in the cluster configuration file.   Flags  Flag name Description -count Specifies the number of records to generate. -interval  Specifies the recording interval in seconds. The default is 2 seconds. -out Specifies the name of the output file. -cec  Records the CEC statistics in binary format. -local Records local system statistics in binary format. -cluster Records cluster statistics in binary format. -trace Specifies a trace level. Trace data is stored under /home/padmin/.topasrec. You can specify a value from 1 - 9. More trace data is generated at higher trace levels. This data is useful for recording status and for debugging purposes. Trace data is collected only for local system recording.   Exit StatusReturn Code Description 0 Success >0 An error occurred   Examples To start recording local system statistics with a sample count of 5 and a sample interval of 60 seconds, type:   topasrec -local -count 5 -interval 60 To start recording CEC statistics with a sample count of 5 and a sample interval of 60 seconds, type:   topasrec -cec -count 5 -interval 60 To start recording cluster statistics with a sample count of 5 and a sample interval of 60, type:   topasrec -cluster -count 5 -interval 60   Related Information The  command.

 unmount command Purpose Unmounts a previously mounted file system, directory, or file.   Syntax unmount   { Directory | File | FileSystem }   Description The unmount command unmounts a previously mounted directory, file, or file system. Processing on the file system, directory, or file completes and it is unmounted.  To unmount local mounts you can specify the device, directory, file, or file system on which it is mounted.   Exit Status See .   Examples To unmount files and directories, type the following command: unmount /home/user/test This unmounts the filesystem mounted at /home/user/test.   Related Information The  command.   Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 uname command Purpose Writes to standard output the name of the operating system that you are using   Syntax uname [  ] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []   Description The machine ID number contains 12 characters in the following digit format: xxyyyyyymmss. The xx positions indicate the system and is always 00. The yyyyyy positions contain the unique ID number for the entire system. The mm position represents the model ID. The ss position is the submodel number and is always 00. The model ID describes the ID of the CPU Planar, not the model of the System as a whole.  You can use the uname -m command sometimes to determine which model you are using. The following list is not complete. Refer to hardware vendor supplied documentation for values in the range E0 - FF. Also note that not all machine types have a machine ID. Many new machines share a common machine ID of 4C.   Flags Flag name Description -a  Displays all information specified with the -m, -n, -r, -s, and -v flags. Cannot be used with the -x flag If the -x flag is specified with the -a flag, the -x flag overrides it. -F  Displays a system identification string comprised of hexadecimal characters.

 vmstat command Purpose Reports virtual memory statistics. Syntax   [ ] [  ] [  ] [ []] [  ] [  ] [ ] [  ] []  [{  |  }  | ALL] ALL] [] [] []   Do not use the  parameter and the  flag together inside . Description The  command reports statistics about kernel threads, virtual memory, disks, traps, and processor activity. Reports that are generated by the  command can be used to balance system load activity. These system-wide statistics (among all processors) are calculated as averages for values that are expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. The  command might return inconsistent statistics because the statistics are not read atomically.  If you run the  command without flags, the report contains a summary of the virtual memory activity since system startup. If you specify the -f flag, the  command reports the number of forks since system startup. The  parameter specifies the name of the physical volume.  The  parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report. If you do not specify the  parameter, the  command generates a single report that contains statistics for the time since system startup and then exits. You can specify the  parameter only with the  parameter. If you specify the  parameter, its value determines the number of reports that are generated and the number of seconds apart. If you specify the  parameter without the  parameter, reports are continuously generated. Do not specify a value of zero to the  parameter.  The kernel maintains statistics for kernel threads, paging, and interrupt activity, which the  command accesses by using the  kernel extension. The disk input/output statistics are maintained by device drivers. For disks, the average transfer rate is determined by using the active time and number of times information is being transferred. The percent active time is computed from the amount of time the drive is busy during the report.  Beginning with , the  command reports the number of physical processors consumed (pc), and the percentage of entitlement consumed (ec), in  environments. These metrics display on the  environments.   The report that is generated by the  command contains a system configuration row and column headings. The system configuration row has the following values:  lcpu Indicates the number of logical processors. mem Indicates the amount of memory. tmem Indicates the true memory size of the LPAR.   This flag is available only when  option is provided and Active Memoryâ¢ Expansion is enabled. ent Displays only when the partition is running with shared processor. drives Displays only when physical volume name is monitored. s Indicates the number of active . It is displayed only when the  flag is specified. memlim Indicates the limit of the memory resource of the . The limit is in megabytes (MB). This information is displayed only for the  with enforced memory resource limit. cpulim Indicates the limit of processor resource of the  in processor units. This information is displayed only for the  with enforced processor resource limit. rset Indicates the type of the rset registry that is associated with a . The type can be regular or exclusive. This information is displayed only for the s that are associated with a rset registry. mmode Indicates memory mode. This metric is displayed automatically in a system with Active Memory Sharing enabled. This metric is also displayed when -c option is used. mpsz Size of the memory pool in gigabytes. This metric is displayed only in shared-memory mode.  The column headings and their descriptions follow:  : Information about . It displays only when the-@ flag is specified.    name.   The   name indicates system-wide statistics. The   name indicates the statistics belong to Global only. When the  command is started with the  option and the  specific information is not available for a metric, then an en dash sign (-) is displayed instead of a value. When the  command is started with the   or started inside a , if the  information is not available for a metric, then that metric is marked with the at sign (@), and the system-wide value is displayed for that metric. If a metric is not supported, then a en dash sign (-) is displayed instead of a value.    kthr: Information about kernel thread states.  r Average number of runnable kernel threads over the sampling interval. Runnable threads consist of the threads that are ready but still waiting to run, and the threads that are already running. b Average number of kernel threads that are placed in the Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) wait queue (awaiting resource, awaiting input/output) over the sampling interval.  Memory: Information about the usage of virtual and real memory. Virtual pages are considered active if they are accessed. A page is 4096 bytes. avm Active virtual pages. fre Size of the free list.   A large portion of real memory is used as a cache for file system data. It is not unusual for the size of the free list to remain small.  Page: Information about page faults and paging activity. This information is averaged over the interval and given in units per second.  re Pager input/output list. pi Pages that are paged in from paging space. po Pages paged out to paging space. fr Pages freed (page replacement). sr Pages that are scanned by page-replacement algorithm. cy Clock cycles by page-replacement algorithm.  Faults: Trap and interrupt rate averages per second over the sampling interval.  in Device interrupts. sy System calls. cs Kernel thread context switches.  CPU: Breakdown of percentage usage of processor time.  us User time. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). sy System time. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). id Processor idle time. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). wa Processor idle time during which the system had outstanding disk/NFS I/O request. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). pc Number of physical processors used. Displayed only if the partition is running with shared processor. ec The percentage of entitled capacity that is consumed. Displayed only if the partition is running with shared processor. Because the time base over which this data is computed can vary, the entitled capacity percentage can sometimes exceed 100%. This excess is noticeable only with small sampling intervals. rc The percentage of processor resource that is used. This information is displayed only for the s with enforced processor resource limit.  Disk: Provides the number of transfers per second to the specified physical volumes that occurred in the sample interval. The parameter can be used to specify one to four names. Transfer statistics are given for each specified drive in the order specified. This count represents requests to the physical device. It does not imply an amount of data that was read or written. Several logical requests can be combined into one physical request. If the  parameter is used, the physical volume names are printed at the beginning of command execution.   If the -I flag is specified, an I/O oriented view is presented with the following column changes.  kthr The p column is displayed in addition to the r and b columns.  p Number of threads waiting for I/O messages to raw devices. Raw devices are those devices that are directly attached to the system. If the -W flag is specified along with the -I flag, an additional w column is also displayed along with the r, b, and p flags. w Number of threads that are waiting for the file system direct I/O and concurrent I/O (CIO). page New fi and fo columns are displayed instead of the re and cy columns.  fi File page-ins per second. fo File page-outs per second.  If the -c flag is specified, Active Memory Expansion view is presented with the following column changes.  memory The columns csz, cfr, and dxm are displayed besides columns avm and fre. csz Current compressed pool size, in 4K page units. cfr Free pages available in compressed pool, in 4K page units. dxm Deficit in Expanded Memory Size, in 4K page units. page New columns ci and co are displayed instead of re and cy columns. ci Number of page-ins per second from compressed pool. co Number of page-outs per second to compressed pool.  If while the  command is running, there is a change in system configuration that affects the output,  prints a warning message about the configuration change. It then continues the output after printing the updated system configuration information and the header.   If the -l flag is specified, an additional "large-page" section is displayed with the following columns: alp Indicates the number of large pages currently in use. flp Indicates the number of large pages on the large page freelist.    If the -p option is specified, additional lines of VMM statistics are displayed for the specified page sizes. With -I and -t options, the -p option produces an additional line for the specified page size. This line contains the following VMM statistics relevant to the specified page size: avm fre re fi fo pi po ci co fr sr cy   The display of the re, fi, fo, and cy options are affected by the -I option. The display of the re, ci, co, and cy options are affected by the -c option. If there is no resource control, then the avm and fre options are system-wide. Therefore, with the -@ option set, both the avm and fre options will be marked with the at sign (@).   These VMM statistics are preceded by a psz column and followed by an siz column. The description of these two columns follows: psz Page size (for example, 4 KB, 64 KB). siz Number of frames of the specified page size that exist on the system. With the -s option, the -p option produces a separate stanza of output that contains only the statistics relevant to the specified page size. This additional stanza is preceded by a page size header.  The -P option produces the following report for the specified page size: pgsz Indicates the page size (for example, 4 KB, 64 KB). Memory Indicates the memory statistics for the specified page sizes. siz The number of frames of the specified page size that exist on the system. avm Active virtual pages applicable to the specified page size. fre Size of the free list for the specified page size. Page Indicates the relevant page faults and paging activity for the specified page size. The page-related columns re, pi, po, fr, sr, cy, fi, fo, ci, and co are also applicable to this report. Flags  If the  (or ) flag is entered on the command line, then the system accepts the  (or ) flag and ignores other flags. If both the  and  flags are specified, the system accepts only the first flag and ignore the second flag.  Flag name Description -@  Reports the Virtual Memory activity of a :  The -@ ALL option indicates that the report pertains to the system and global environment, in addition to all of the  in the system.   The values that are system-wide statistics are marked with dash sign (-) against the  section. The -@ flag indicates that the activity is only for that . The system-wide statistics are marked with the at sign (@).  Do not use the -@ flag with any combination of the -i flag. -c Displays memory compression statistics with the new columns of output, csz, cfr, and dxm under the heading memory, and columns ci and co under the heading page instead of the columns re and cy.  This option is available only when Active Memory Expansion is enabled. -f Reports the number of forks since system startup. -i Displays the number of interrupts that are taken by each device since system startup.  The -I, -t, -w, and -l flags are ignored when they are specified with the -i flag. -I Displays I/O oriented view with the new columns of output, p under heading kthr,and columns fi and fo under heading page instead of the columns re and cy in the page heading. -l Displays an extra "large-page" section with the alp and flp columns. -p pagesize Appends the VMM statistics for the specified page size to the regular  output. -P pagesize Displays only the VMM statistics, which are relevant for the specified page size. -s Writes to standard output the contents of the sum structure, which contains an absolute count of paging events since system initialization. The -s flag can only be used with the -v flag. These events are described as follows:  address translation faults Incremented for each occurrence of an address translation page fault. I/O may or may not be required to resolve the page fault. Storage protection page faults (lock misses) are not included in this count. -s backtracks  Incremented for each page fault that occurs while resolving a previous page fault. (The new page fault must be resolved first and then initial page faults can be backtracked.) CPU context switches Incremented for each processor context switch (dispatch of a new process). decrementer interrupts Incremented on each decrementer interrupt. device interrupts Incremented on each hardware interrupt. executable-filled page faults Incremented for each instruction page fault. extend XPT waits  Incremented each time that a process is waited by VMM due to a commit in progress for the segments accessed. free frame waits Incremented each time that a process requests a page frame. The free list is empty, and the process is forced to wait while the free list is replenished. iodones Incremented at the completion of each VMM I/O request. mpc send interrupts Incremented on each mpc send interrupt. mpc receive interrupts Incremented on each mpc receive interrupt. page ins Incremented for each page read in by the virtual memory manager. The count is incremented for page ins from page space and file space. Along with the page-out statistic, this value represents the total amount of real I/O initiated by the virtual memory manager. page outs Incremented for each page that is written out by the virtual memory manager. The count is incremented for page outs to page space and for page outs to file space. Along with the page in statistic, this statistic represents the total amount of real I/O initiated by the virtual memory manager. paging space page ins Incremented for VMM initiated page ins from paging space only. paging space page outs Incremented for VMM initiated page outs to paging space only. pages examined by the clock VMM uses a clock-algorithm to implement a pseudo least recently used (lru) page replacement scheme. Pages are aged by being examined by the clock. This count is incremented for each page examined by the clock. pages freed by the clock Incremented for each page the clock algorithm selects to free from real memory. pending I/O waits Incremented each time that a process is waited by VMM for a page-in I/O to complete. -s phantom interrupts Incremented on each phantom interrupt revolutions of the clock hand Incremented for each VMM clock revolution (that is after each complete scan of memory). start I/Os Incremented for each read or write I/O request that is initiated by VMM. syscalls  Incremented for each system call. total reclaims Incremented when an address translation fault can be satisfied without initiating a new I/O request. This can occur if the page has been previously requested by VMM, but the I/O has not yet completed; or if the page was pre-fetched by VMM's read-ahead algorithm, but was hidden from the faulting segment; or if the page has been put on the free list and has not yet been reused. traps  Not maintained by the operating system. zero-filled page faults Incremented if the page fault is to working storage and can be satisfied by assigning a frame and zero-filling it.  compressed pool page ins  Number of page-ins from Compressed Pool since system boot. compressed pool page outs   Number of page-outs to Compressed Pool since system boot. -s When used with the -p pagesize option, the -s option appends the sum structure for the specified page size to the system-wide sum structure. This additional stanza is preceded by a page size header (for example, 4K pages). The following details are not be displayed in this pagesize-based stanza as these statistics are not related to page sizes:  Processor context switches Device interrupts Software interrupts Decrementer interrupts MPC-sent interrupts MPC-received interrupts Phantom interrupts Traps Syscalls   When the -s flag is used with the -@ ALL option, the system-wide statistics are repeated in the  section. When the -s flag is used with the  option, all metrics are reported and the system-wide statistics are marked with the at sign (@). When the -s flag is used with the -l flag, the  command displays the following metric:  large-page hi water count Specifies the maximum value of the large-page inuse count.   -S  Multiplies the statistics of the processor with a value of 10power. The default value of the power is 0. The following statistics are scaled:  us sy id wa pc ec   Do not use the -S flag with the -f, -s, -i, -v, or -p flags. When the -S flag is specified, the us, sy, id, and wa statistics change. By default, the us, sy, id, and wa statistics are relative to the processor consumption of . When the -S flag is specified with a value of power that is not equal to zero, these statistics will be relative to system-wide processor consumption. The value of power for -S flag can be only between 0 and 3.   -t Prints the time-stamp next to each line of output of . The time-stamp is displayed in the HH:MM:SS format.   Time stamp is not be printed if -f, -s, or -i flags are specified. -v Writes to standard output various statistics maintained by the Virtual Memory Manager. The -v flag can only be used with the -s flag.  If you specify the -v flag, the following statistics are displayed:  compressed percentage Percentage of memory used by compressed pages.  client filesystem I/Os blocked with no fsbuf Number of client filesystem I/O requests blocked because no fsbuf was available. NFS (Network File System) and VxFS (Veritas) are client filesystems.

This option is allowed only with -I flag.   If Active Memory Expansion is enabled, the  reports memory statistics in the expanded view. However, if the environment variable AME_MEMVIEW is set to TRUE, the memory statistics  represent the true view. The AME_MEMVIEW environment variable has no impact on memory statistics reported using the -c option.   SecurityAny user can run the vmstat command. If the user is not a root user, the view will be limited to the user's own processes.  If  is activated and the vios.system.stat.memory role is attributed to the user, then that user can see the same view that the root user does.

Valid values for adapter_type: client server   If you specify a value for adapter type, the Integrated Virtualization Manager (IVM) requires the adapter type to be a client.  Optional values: wwpn_list, is_required, remote_slot_num   When you add a virtual fibre channel adapter, wwpn_list can be left blank to allow IVM to automatically assign worldwide port names to the client adapter.  If you leave wwpn_list blank and the virtual slot number specified for this adapter already contains a virtual fibre channel adapter, IVM will use the worldwide port names that are already assigned.  New worldwide port names will only be generated if it is a new adapter. If you specify a wwpn_list value, there must be exactly two values.  Each worldwide port name must be a 16-character hexadecimal value.  These values are not case sensitive.   Valid values for is_required:  0 - no  1 - yes A value of none or an empty string indicates that no virtual fibre channel adapters should be assigned.   If the logical partition being changed is the Virtual I/O Server, you cannot change the current configuration. The IVM handles the client and server adapter as a pair; thus, IVM handles modifications automatically. Â   virtual_scsi_adapters Comma-separated list of virtual SCSI adapters. Each item in this list has the format:  slot_num/adapter_type/remote_lpar_id/remote_lpar_name/ remote_slot_num/is_required  The attribute names are not present in the list, just their values are present.

For example, 2/client//lpar2/3/0 specifies a virtual client SCSI adapter with a virtual slot number of 2, a server partition name of lpar2, a server slot number of 3, and is not required. The server partition ID was omitted.  Required values: slot_num, adapter_type, remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name    You can specify remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, or both, but at least one of the values is required.  Optional values: is_required, remote_slot_num    IVM requires that virtual slot number 2 always contain a virtual SCSI adapter, so if you specify adapters in any other slots, the default adapter is still created in slot number 2.  If you use the chsyscfg command with an empty list for the virtual_scsi_adapters attribute, all virtual SCSI adapters are removed, except the default adapter.  Valid values for adapter_type:  client: client adapter server: server adapter, valid for Virtual I/O Server logical partitions only  Valid values for is_required: 0 - no 1 - yes Â  Attribute names for the managed system lpar_comm_default Returns the lpar_comm_ipaddr to using the default IP address configured on the system as reported by lstcpip -interfaces.

Otherwise, if no filter is used, then all the partitions in the managed system will be listed. The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format. The filter data must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  The format of the filter data is as follows:  "filter-name=value,filter-name=value,..."  Note that certain filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows: ""filter-name=value,value,...",..."  When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotation marks. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quotation marks might need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\'  character.   Â  Unless otherwise indicated, multiple values can be specified for each filter.

 IVM mkgencfg command Purpose Performs the initial logical partition configuration for the managed system.  This command is operable only in an  environment.   Syntax mkgencfg -o init [-i "ConfigurationData" ] [ -m ManagedSystem ]   Description The mkgencfg command performs the initial logical partition configuration for the managed system.  As part of the initial configuration, virtual Ethernet adapters are created in the management partition.  The virtual Ethernet MAC address prefix can optionally be configured through this command.   Flags Flag name Description -o Operation 	 The type of operations: init - Perform initial logical partition configuration actions for the managed system  -i ConfigurationData The configuration data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in a comma separated value (CSV) format.   The format of a configuration record is as follows:   "attribute-name=value,attribute-name=value,..."    Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:    ""attribute-name=value,value,...",..."    When you specify a list of values, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  Depending on the shell being used, nested double quotation marks might need to be preceded by an escape character.   Valid Attributes for Configuration Data:   mac_prefix The prefix needs to be a 3 byte hexadecimal value. It specifies the first 2.5 bytes of the MAC address to be assigned to all virtual Ethernet adapters for this managed system. The value cannot be a multicast address (010000 bit must be off), and needs to be a private address (020000 bit must be on). For example, a valid MAC address prefix is 0642A0. pend_configured_max_lpars The maximum number of partitions supported by the management partition after the next restart. Â   virtual_eth_mac_base_value The virtual Ethernet MAC address base value is a per partition value.  The base value is used to build the MAC addresses for each virtual Ethernet adapter in that partition.  The base value is the first 5 bytes of the MAC address.  The virtual slot number of the virtual Ethernet adapter makes up the last byte. If you do not assign a base value, one is generated automatically using the following format: Base value = 0xSSSSSBBBBB Where SSSSS is the system wide MAC address prefix and BBBBB is a randomly generated sequence of bits (guaranteed to be unique within this physical system).   The system wide MAC prefix is randomly generated unless you override it using mkgencfg -o init -i mac_prefix. If the base value is automatically generated, then the MAC address format for a virtual Ethernet adapter is 0xSSSSSBBBBBNN, where NN is the slot number. If you specify the base value using mkgencfg for partition 1 or mksyscfg/chsyscfg for any other partition, then the format is 0xBBBBBBBBBBNN, where BBBBBBBBBB is the base value that you specified. If a virtual Ethernet adapter is in a slot greater than or equal to 256, then the slot number overflows into the base value, since it does not fit in 1 byte.  For example,  handles it as 0xBBBBBBBBBB00 + 0x00000000NNNN. The mkgencfg command is the only way to specify the base value for partition 1.  After this value is set, you cannot change it without losing all partition configuration. If you need to change the value, use the lpcfgop command. The value is set implicitly when mkgencfg is running. The value will be generated automatically, unless you specify the value. The mkgencfg command runs implicitly when you run your first change command. You can change the base value for any other partition, when the partition is powered off.   A side effect of setting the base value for partition 1 with mkgencfg, is that the system wide prefix is set to the first 2.5 bytes of the partition 1 base value.  As a result, there are restrictions on setting both mac_prefix and virtual_eth_mac_base_value with mkgencfg at the same time.  If you specify both, the mac_prefix value needs to be equal to the first 2.5 bytes of the virtual_eth_mac_base_value value.       -m ManagedSystem The name of the managed system.  This attribute is optional because there is only one system to manage. The name might either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt-mmm*ssssssss,  where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and ssssssss is the serial number of the managed system.   Exit Status This command has a return code of zero on success.   Security This command is not accessible by users with the ViewOnly role.   Examples To initialize the logical partition configuration for the managed system using defaults, type:  mkgencfg -o init   To initialize the logical partition configuration for the managed system with support for 17 partitions and a MAC prefix of 0x06ABC0, type:  mkgencfg -o init -i "pend_lpm_max_lpars=17,mac_prefix=06ABC0"   Parent topic:  Parent topic:

The name might either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt-mmm*ssssssss,  where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and ssssssss is the serial number of the managed system. -f  ConfigurationFile The name of the file containing  the  configuration  data  needed  to  change  the resources.   The  configuration data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  These attribute name/value pairs  form a configuration record.  A line feed marks the end of a configuration record.  The file must contain one configuration record for each resource to  be  changed,  and each  configuration  record  must  be for the same resource type.  If the resource type is the managed system or the managed frame, then the file must  contain  only one configuration record. The format of a configuration record is as follows:  attribute-name=value,attribute-name=value,...<LF>  Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:   "attribute-name=value,value,...",...<LF>  When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotation marks.

In shared processing mode, this refers to virtual processors. max_proc_units The maximum number of processing units for this partition Â  max_virtual_slots Maximum number of virtual I/O adapter slots.   The system determines this value. mem_mode The partition memory mode.  ded - dedicated memory shared - shared memory If the memory mode is shared, then the logical partition cannot be assigned any physical I/O slots or host Ethernet adapter resources, the proc_mode attribute on the logical partition must be shared, and a memory pool must exist.  If the memory mode is omitted, then it is assumed to be a dedicated memory mode. The Virtual I/O Server logical partition only supports the dedicated memory mode. mem_weight The shared memory weight of the logical partition that uses shared memory.  This attribute is used for determining the priority of logical partitions in a memory pool for distribution of memory. The weight must be a value from 0 - 255.  If a value is not specified, the default is 128. min_procs The minimum number of processors for this partition.  In shared processing mode, this refers to virtual processors. min_proc_units The minimum number of processing units for this partition Â  op_console_slot The location of the virtual I/O slot that contains the directly-attached operations console device for the  logical partition. The default value is none. paging_device The paging space device to use if a memory pool is used.

Optional values are additional_vlan_ids, and is_trunk. Valid values for is_ieee, is_trunk, and is_required:  0 - no  1 - yes For example, 4/0/2//0/0 specifies a virtual Ethernet adapter with a virtual slot number of 4, is not IEEE 802.1Q enabled, has a port virtual LAN ID of 2, no additional virtual LAN IDs, it is not a trunk adapter, and is not required. Â  virtual_fc_adapters Comma-separated list of virtual fibre channel adapters.  Each item in this list has the following format:  virtual slot num/adapter_type/remote_lpar_id/ remote_lpar_name/remote_slot_num/wwpn_list/is_required Required values: remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, adapter_type, virtual_slot_num     You can specify either remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, or use them both, but at least one of the values is required.  Valid values for adapter_type: client server   If you specify a value for adapter type, the Integrated Virtualization Manager (IVM) requires the adapter type to be a client.  Optional values: wwpn_list, is_required, remote_slot_num   When you add a virtual fibre channel adapter, wwpn_list can be left blank to allow IVM to automatically assign worldwide port names to the client adapter.  If you leave wwpn_list blank and the virtual slot number specified for this adapter already contains a virtual fibre channel adapter, IVM will use the worldwide port names that are already assigned.  New worldwide port names will only be generated if it is a new adapter. If you specify a wwpn_list value, there must be exactly two values.  Each worldwide port name must be a 16-character hexadecimal value.  These values are not case sensitive.   Valid values for is_required:  0 - no  1 - yes A value of none or an empty string indicates that no virtual fibre channel adapters should be assigned.   If the logical partition being changed is the Virtual I/O Server, you cannot change the current configuration. The IVM handles the client and server adapter as a pair; therefore, IVM handles changes automatically. Â  virtual_scsi_adapters Comma-separated list of virtual SCSI adapters. Each item in this list has the format:  slot_num/adapter_type/remote_lpar_id/remote_lpar_name/ remote_slot_num/is_required  The attribute names are not present in the list, just their values are present. If an attribute is optional and is not to be included, then no value is specified for that attribute. For example, 2/client//lpar2/3/0 specifies a virtual client SCSI adapter with a virtual slot number of 2, a server partition name of lpar2, a server slot number of 3, and is not required. The server partition ID was omitted.  Required values: slot_num, adapter_type, remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name    You can specify remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, or both, but at least one of the values is required.  Optional values: is_required, remote_slot_num    IVM requires that virtual slot number 2 always contain a virtual SCSI adapter, so if you specify adapters in any other slots, the default adapter is still created in slot number 2.  If you use the chsyscfg command with an empty list for the virtual_scsi_adapters attribute, all virtual SCSI adapters are removed, except the default adapter.  Valid values for adapter_type:  client: client adapter server: server adapter, valid for Virtual I/O Server logical partitions only  Valid values for is_required: 0 - no 1 - yes work_group_id Valid values:  none: do not participate in the workload management group  1: participate in the workload management group -i ConfigurationData This option allows you to enter configuration data on the command line, instead of using a file. Data entered on the command line must follow the same format as data in a file, and must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  When this option is used, only a single resource can be changed.

 chlv command Purpose Changes the characteristics of a logical volume.   Syntax To change the name of a logical volume:  chlv {  NewLogicalVolumeName | -bbr value}LogicalVolume   Description The chlv command changes the characteristics of a logical volume according to the command flags. The LogicalVolume parameter can be a logical volume name or logical volume ID. The chlv command can rename and set the bad-block relocation (BBR) policy. Changing the name of a logical volume and setting the bad-block relocation policy are the only supported options.   A logical volume that has been assigned as a backing device cannot be renamed. Although supported, it is not recommended that the bad-block relocation policy be enabled on the Virtual I/O Server for Virtual Small Computer System Interface (VSCSI) devices. Instead, the bad-block relocation policy needs to be enabled for VSCSI devices on the client.  Doing so ensures that the bad-block relocation policy is enabled for VSCSI devices that use logical volumes and physical volumes as storage and provides better performance.

Doing so results in a corrupted file system because some data is not copied.   The cplv command copies the contents of SourceLogicalVolume to a new or existing logical volume. The SourceLogicalVolume parameter can be a logical volume name or a logical volume ID. The cplv command creates a new logical volume with a system-generated name by using the default syntax. The system-generated name is displayed.   The cplv command cannot copy logical volumes which are in the open state, including logical volumes that are being used as backing devices for virtual storage.   Flags Flag name Description -f Copies to an existing logical volume without requesting user confirmation. -lv NewLogicalVolume Specifies the name to use, in place of a system-generated name, for the new logical volume. Logical volume names must be unique systemwide names, and can range from 1 to 15 characters. -prefix Prefix Specifies a prefix to use in building a system-generated name for the new logical volume. The prefix must be less than or equal to 13 characters. A name cannot be a name already used by another device. -vg VolumeGroup Specifies the volume group where the new logical volume resides. If this is not specified, the new logical volume resides in the same volume group as the SourceLogicalVolume.   Examples To copy the contents of logical volume fslv03 to a new logical volume, type:   cplv fslv03  The new logical volume is created, placed in the same volume group as fslv03, and named by the system. To copy the contents of logical volume fslv03 to a new logical volume in volume group vg02, type:   cplv  -vg vg02 fslv03  The new logical volume is created, named, and added to volume group vg02.

 cl_snmp command Purpose Issues Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests to agents and processes SNMP responses returned by agents.    Syntax cl_snmp [][ Level] [ TargetHost] [ TimeoutValue] [ RetryNumber] [ MaxRepetitions] [ ConfigurationFile] [ PortNumber] [ ] [ NonRepeaters] Function [MIBvariable][VariableType][Value][...]]    Description Use the cl_snmp command to issue SNMP requests to agents and to process SNMP responses returned by agents. The  cl_snmp command can be used for SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 requests.   Flags Flag name Description -com  Specifies the community name used to access the specified variables at the destination SNMP agent. If you do not specify a community name, the default name is public. Community names are not required when using the user-based security model.   Community names are case sensitive. -debug Level  Specifies a debugging level during run time. The default is 0. The higher the debugging level, the greater the number of messages that are displayed. The levels can be from 0 through 4. -host TargetHost   Specifies the target host to which you want to send a request. This can be an Internet protocol address, a host name, or a winSNMP name in the clsnmp.conf configuration file. If you do not specify a host, the default is the local host. -timeout TimeoutValue  Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) that the cl_snmp command waits for a reply from the SNMP agent. The default is 3. -retry RetryNumber  Specifies the maximum number of times to retry the command if it timed out. The default is 2. -max MaxRepetitions   Specifies the number of lexicographic successors to be returned for each variable binding pair after the first -non number successors. The parameter applies only to the getbulk request. This is ignored if the function request is not a getbulk request. For example, starting with successor -non number+1, return -max number of successors for each variable binding pair. The default is 10.  -file ConfigurationFile Specifies the full path and file name of the configuration file. -port PortNumber Specifies the number of the port that listens for traps. If a port number is not specified, the cl_snmp trap function listens on the well-known port 162, which is the default port for cl_snmp traps. -verbose  Specifies that the output from a request should be displayed using verbose output, for example, using the textual name instead of the MIB object identifier. -non NonRepeaters Specifies the number of variable binding pairs (name/value), starting with the first, for which only a single successor is returned. This parameter applies only to getbulk requests. This is ignored if the function request is not a getbulk request. The default is 0. Function [MIBvariable] [VariableType] [Value] [...]] Specifies the SNMP function or operation to perform, which is one of the following:  get  getnext getbulk  set  walk trap findname  MIBVariable  Specifies the Management Information Base (MIB) object, using its object descriptor (textual name), object identifier in ASN.1         notation, or a combination of the two. When used with the walk function, this is the MIB object prefix. A prefix can be any leading portion of  the complete object identifier. When used with the findname command, this object identifier is in the ASN.1 notation. Value Specifies the value to be set by the SET function. If white space is needed in the value, enclose the value in quotation marks. To set a variable to a value that is also a type, you must specify the type. VariableType Specifies the type of value being set. To complete an SNMP SET request, the SMI_type must be known. If no type is specified,             cl_snmp command searches first the /etc/mib.defs file and then the compiled MIB to determine the type. If the variable is not found, an error is returned. If a VariableType is specified, the VariableType  takes precedence over any type that may be assigned in the MIB. The VariableType and value must be compatible. For example, if you specify a type of number and a value of foo, an error is  returned because foo is not a number. VariableType is not case sensitive. Valid variable types are:       bitstring   counter counter32  counter64    display or displaystring  gauge gauge32  integer  integer32     ipaddress   nsapaddress    null    objectidentifier or OID     octetstring   opaque   opaqueascii   timeticks    uinteger             Request Types Request Type name Description findname  Sends a request that a search be done to obtain the textual name, for a given MIBVariable input, whose internal ASN.1 value best matches the input ASN.1 value. The search first checks the  /etc/mib.defs file, and if a matching textual name is not found, it continues with the compiled management information base (MIB). Only one MIBVariable is allowed per cl_snmp findname invocation. get   Sends a request to an SNMP agent for a specific MIB variable. The cl_snmp command then waits for a response or times out. getbulk  Obtains the value of the variables in the MIB tree specified by the object identifier (OID) or MIB variable name. A single getbulk performs the same function as a series of getnext commands, with fewer data exchanges between the cl_snmp command and the SNMP agent. getnext  Sends a request to an SNMP agent for the next MIB variable that lexicographically follows the MIBVariable specified. The cl_snmp command then waits for a response or times out. set  Sends a request to an SNMP agent to set a specific MIBVariable.  The cl_snmp command then waits for a response or times out. trap Listens for SNMP traps and displays trap information when they occur. Uses the default, well-known port 162 or the port number specified on the -port option. The cl_snmp trap function continues to listen for traps until the process is killed or canceled. walk Issues a getnext request for a specified prefix, then continues to issue getnext requests for as long as there are variables that match the specified prefix. A prefix can be any leading portion of the complete object identifier.   Exit Status See .

Max Packets on S/W Transmit Queue  The maximum number of outgoing packets ever queued to 	the software transmit queue. S/W Transmit Queue Overflow  The number of outgoing packets which have overflowed 	the software transmit queue. Current S/W+H/W Transmit Queue Length The number of pending outgoing packets on either the 	software transmit queue or the hardware transmit queue. Broadcast Packets The number of broadcast packets transmitted without 	any error. Multicast Packets  The number of multicast packets transmitted without 	any error. No Carrier Sense  The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	no carrier sense error. DMA Underrun The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	DMA underrun error. Lost CTS Errors  The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	loss of the Clear-to-Send signal error. Max Collision Errors The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to too 	many collisions. The number of collisions encountered exceeded the number 	of retries on the adapter. Late Collision Errors  The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	late collision error. Deferred The number of outgoing packets deferred during transmission. 	Deferred means that the adapter had to defer while trying to transmit a frame. 	This condition occurs if the network is busy when the adapter is ready to 	transmit. The adapter will only defer the first attempt to send a packet. 	After that the adapter will transmit the packet without checking. If the network 	is still busy then a collision will be recorded. SQE Test Contains the number of "Signal Quality Error" Tests 	(i.e. Heartbeat) performed successfully during transmission. Timeout Errors The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to adapter 	reported timeout errors. Single Collision Count The number of outgoing packets with single (only one) 	collision encountered during transmission. Multiple Collision Count The number of outgoing packets with multiple (2 - 15) 	collisions encountered during transmission Current HW Transmit Queue Length  The number of outgoing packets which currently exist 	on the hardware transmit queue. CRC Errors The number of incoming packets with the Checksum (FCS) 	error. DMA Overrun The number of incoming packets with the DMA overrun 	error. Alignment Errors  The number of incoming packets with the alignment error. No Resource Errors  The number of incoming packets dropped by the hardware 	due to the no resource error. This error usually occurs because the receive 	buffers on the adapter were exhausted. Some adapters may have the size of 	the receive buffers as a configurable parameter. Check the device configuration 	attributes for possible tuning information. Receive Collision Errors  The number of incoming packets with the collision errors 	during the reception. Packet Too Short Errors The number of incoming packets with the length error 	indicating that the packet size is less than the Ethernet minimum packet size. Packet Too Long Errors  The number of incoming packets with the length error 	indicating that the packet size is bigger than the Ethernet maximum packet 	size. Packets Discarded by Adapter  The number of incoming packets dropped by the hardware 	for any other reasons. Receiver Start Count The number of times that the receiver (receive unit) 	on the adapter has been started.  	 Receive Statistics Fields			 			Field name Description Packets 							 The number of packets received successfully by the 								device. Bytes The number of bytes received successfully by the 								device. Interrupts The number of receive interrupts received by the 								driver from the adapter. Receive Errors  The number of input errors encountered on the 								device. This is a counter for unsuccessful reception due to 								hardware/network errors. Packets Dropped  The number of packets received by the device 								driver from this device which were not (for any reason) given to a 								network demuxer.

No Resource Errors The number of incoming packets dropped by the 								hardware due to the no resource error. Receive Collision Errors  The number of incoming packets with the collision 								errors during the reception. Packet Too Short Errors The number of incoming packets with the length 								error indicating that the packet size is less than the Ethernet 								minimum packet size. Packet Too Long Errors The number of incoming packets with the length 								error indicating that the packet size is bigger than the Ethernet 								maximum packet size. Packets Discarded by Adapter The number of incoming packets dropped by the 								hardware for any other reasons. Receiver Start Count The number of times that the receiver (receive 								unit) on the adapter has been started. 		 General Statistics Fields			 			Field name Description No mbuf Errors The number of times that mbufs were not available 								to the device driver. This usually occurs during receive operations 								when the driver must obtain mbuf buffers to process inbound packets. 								If the mbuf pool for the requested size is empty, the packet will be 								discarded. The netstat -m command can be used to confirm 								this. Adapter Reset Count The number of times that the adapter has been 								restarted (re-initialized). Adapter Data Rate The maximum data rate of the adapter in Mbps 								(megabits per second). Driver Flags The device driver internal status flags that are 								currently turned on. 		 Device Specific Statistics Fields			 			This part of the display might be different for each type of adapter. It might 				contain adapter-specific information and extended statistics that were not included 				in the general statistics. Some adapters might not have any device-specific 				statistics. 			 Receive Address Match Errors statistic of devices might increase, when the adapter 				receives a unicast packet with a destination MAC address that does not match the MAC 				address of the adapter. This scenario might happen when an adapter is used by a 					 to bridge network 				traffic for client LPARs.

 optimizenet command Purpose Manages network tuning parameters.   Syntax optimizenet  [  |  ] {   Tunable[=NewValue] |  Tunable }   optimizenet  [ Tunable ]   optimizenet  [ Tunable ]   Description The optimizenet command is used to configure network tuning parameters. The optimizenet command sets or displays current or next boot values for network tuning parameters. This command can also make permanent changes or defer changes until the next reboot. Whether the command sets or displays a parameter is determined by the accompanying flag. The -set flag performs both actions. It can either display the value of a parameter or set a new value for a parameter.  If the -list flag is specified without any Tunables, only Tunables modifiable by this command will be displayed.   Flags Flag name Description -default Tunable Resets Tunable to its default value. If the Tunable needs to be changed (not currently set to its default value) and it is of type Reboot, it will not be changed; a warning displays instead. -h Tunable Displays help about Tunable parameter if one is specified.  -list [Tunable] Lists the characteristics of one or all Tunables, one per line, using the following format:   NAME                      CUR DEF BOOT MIN MAX  UNIT     TYPE     DEPENDENCIES  ------------------------------------------------------------------ General Network Parameters  -----------------------------------------------------------------  sockthresh                85  85  85   0   100  %_of_thewall D  -----------------------------------------------------------------  fasttimo                  200 200 200  50  200  millisecond  D  -----------------------------------------------------------------  inet_stack_size           16  16  16   1        kbyte        R  -----------------------------------------------------------------  where CUR  current value  DEF  default value  BOOT reboot value  MIN minimal value MAX maximum value  UNIT tunable unit of measure  TYPE Parameter type: D (Dynamic), S (Static), R (Reboot), B (Bosboot), M (Mount), I (Incremental), and C (Connect)  DEPENDENCIES List of dependent tunable parameters, one per line -perm Makes changes apply to both current and reboot values when used in combination with -set or -default. These combinations cannot be used on Reboot type parameters because their current value can't be changed. When used with -set without specifying a new value, values displays only if the current and next boot values for a parameter are the same. Otherwise NONE displays as the value. -reboot Makes changes apply to reboot values when used in combination with -set or -default. When used with -set without specifying a new value, next boot values for tunables display instead of the current values. -set Tunable [=NewValue ] Displays the value or sets the Tunable to NewValue. If a tunable needs to be changed (the specified value is different than current value), and is of type Reboot it will not be changed but a warning displays instead.  When -reboot is used in combination without a new value, the nextboot value for Tunable is displayed. When -perm is used in combination without a new value, a value displays only if the current and next boot values for tunable are the same Otherwise NONE displays as the value.   Network tunable parameters Parameter Description arptab_bsiz   Purpose: Specifies Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table bucket size. Values:  Default: 7  Range: 1 to MAXSHORT  Type: Reboot Diagnosis netstat -protocol arp will show the number of ARP packets sent and the number of ARP entries purged from the ARP table. If large number of entries are being purged, the ARP table size should be increased.  arptab_nb  Purpose: Specifies the number of ARP table buckets. Values:  Default: 73 Range: 1 to MAXSHORT Type: Reboot Diagnosis: netstat -protocol arp will show the number of ARP packets sent and the number of ARP entries purged from the ARP table. If large number of entries are being purged, the ARP table size should be increased.   Increase this value for systems that have a large number of clients or servers. The default provides for 73 x 7 = 511 ARP entries, but assumes an even hash distribution.   clean_partial_conns  Purpose: Specifies whether or not SYN (synchronizes the sequence number) attacks are being avoided.  Values:  Default: 0 (off) Range: 0 or 1 Type: Dynamic Tuning: This option should be turned on for servers that need to protect against network attacks. If on, randomly removes partial connections to make room for new non-attack connections.  net_malloc_police  Purpose: Specifies the size of the net_malloc and net_free trace buffers.  Values:  Default: 0 Range: 0 to MAXINT Type: Dynamic Tuning: If the value of this variable is non-zero, all net_malloc and net_free buffers will be traced in a kernel buffer and by system trace hook HKWD_NET_MALLOC. Additional error-checking will also be enabled. This includes checks for freeing a free buffer, alignment, and buffer overwrite. Enable this parameter only when investigating some network problem, because performance is affected negatively when turned on. The default value is zero (policing off). Values of net_malloc_police larger than 1024 will allocate that many items in the kernel buffer for tracing.  rfc1323  Purpose: Enables window scaling and time stamps as specified by RFC 1323 (TCP Extensions for High Performance). Window scaling allows the TCP window sizes (tcp_recvspace and tcp_sendspace) to be larger than 64KB (65536) and is typically used for large MTU networks.  Values:  Default: 0 (off) Range: 0 or 1 Type: Connect Tuning: The default value of 0 disables the RFC enhancements on a systemwide scale. A value of 1 specifies that all TCP connections will attempt to negotiate the RFC enhancements. Make changes before attempting to set tcp_sendspace and tcp_recvspace to more than 64 KB.   route_expire  Purpose: Specifies whether unused routes created by cloning, or created and modified by redirects expire.  Values:  Default: 1 (on) Range: 0 or 1 Type: Dynamic Tuning: A value of 1 allows route expiration, which is the default. Negative values are not allowed for this option.   tcp_pmtu_discover  Purpose: Enables or disables path MTU discovery for TCP applications. Values:  Default: 1 Range: 0 or 1 Type: Dynamic Tuning: A value of 0 disables path MTU discovery for TCP applications, while a value of 1 enables it.  tcp_recvspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket buffer size for receiving data. This affects the window size used by TCP.  Values:  Default: 16384 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Diagnosis: Setting the socket buffer size to 16 KB (16,384) improves performance over standard Ethernet and Token-Ring networks. Lower bandwidth networks, such as Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), or higher bandwidth networks, such as Serial Optical Link, should have different optimum buffer sizes. The optimum buffer size is the product of the media bandwidth and the average round-trip time of a packet.  For high-speed networks, like gigabit Ethernet or ATM 622, a value of 65536 should be used for the minimum size for best performance. For values larger than 65536, you must enable rfc1323 (rfc1323=1) to enable TCP window scaling.  tcp_sendspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket buffer size for sending data.  Values:  Default: 16384 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Tuning: This affects the window size used by TCP. Setting the socket buffer size to 16 KB (16,384) improves performance over standard Ethernet networks.  Lower bandwidth networks, such as Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), or higher bandwidth networks, such as Serial Optical Link, should have different optimum buffer sizes. The optimum buffer size is the product of the media bandwidth and the average round-trip time of a packet:  (optimum_window=bandwidth * average_round_trip_time) For high-speed networks, like gigabit Ethernet or ATM 622, a value of 65536 should be used for the minimum size for best performance. For values larger than 65536, you must enable rfc1323 (rfc1323=1) to enable TCP window scaling. udp_recvspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket-buffer size for receiving UDP data.  Values:  Default: 42080 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Diagnosis: Nonzero n in netstat -stats report of udp: n socket buffer overflows  Tuning: Increase size, preferably to multiple of 4096.   udp_sendspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket-buffer size for sending UDP data.  Values:  Default: 9216 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Diagnosis: Increase size, preferably to multiple of 4096.     Exit Status See .   Examples To display the maximum size of the mbuf pool, type: optimizenet -set thewall   To change the default socket buffer sizes on your system, type:  optimizenet -reboot -set tcp_sendspace=32768 To use a machine as an internet work router over TCP/IP networks, type:  optimizenet -set ipforwarding=1     To list the current and reboot value, range, unit, type and dependencies of the arptab_bsiz parameter, type: optimizenet -list arptab_bsiz    To display help information on arptab_bsiz, type:   optimizenet -h arptab_bsiz      Related Information The  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, and the  command.

 ping command Purpose Sends an echo request to a network host.   Syntax ping [   ] [ ] [   PacketSize ] [  hostname/IP_addr ] Host [  Count ]   Description The ping command sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ECHO_REQUEST to obtain an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway. The ping command is useful for: Determining the status of the network and various foreign hosts. Tracking and isolating hardware and software problems. Testing, measuring, and managing networks.  If the host is operational and on the network, it responds to the echo. Each echo request contains an Internet Protocol (IP) and ICMP header, followed by a timeval structure, and enough bytes to fill out the packet. The default is to continuously send echo requests until an Interrupt is received (Ctrl-C).  The ping command sends one datagram per second and prints one line of output for every response received. The ping command calculates round-trip times and packet loss statistics, and displays a brief summary on completion. The ping command completes when the program times out or on receipt of a SIGINT signal. The Host parameter is either a valid host name or Internet address.  By default, the ping command will continue to send echo requests to the display until an Interrupt is received (Ctrl-C). Because of the load that continuous echo requests can place on the system, repeated requests should be used primarily for problem isolation.   Flags Flag name Description -n Specifies numeric output only. No attempt is made to look up symbolic names for host addresses. -r Bypasses the routing tables and sends directly to a host on an attached network. If the Host is not on a directly connected network, the ping command generates an error message. This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that no longer has a route through it. -s PacketSize Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data. -src hostname/IP_addr Uses the IP address as the source address in outgoing ping packets. On hosts with more than one IP address, the -src flag can be used to force the source address to be something other than the IP address of the interface on which the packet is sent. If the IP address is not one of the machine's interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent.   Parameters Parameter Description Count Specifies the number of echo requests to be sent (and received). This parameter is included for compatibility with previous versions of the ping command.   Exit Status See .

 seastat command Purpose Generates a report to view, per client, Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics.   Syntax To display Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics, per client.  seastat  Shared Ethernet Adapter device name [ |  searchtype=value ]  To clear all Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics that have been gathered per client.  seastat  Shared Ethernet Adapter device name    DescriptionThe  command generates a report to view, per client, shared ethernet adapter statistics. To gather network statistics at a per-client level, advanced accounting can be enabled on the Shared Ethernet Adapter to provide more information about its network traffic. To enable per-client statistics, the VIOS administrator can set the Shared Ethernet Adapter accounting attribute to enabled. The default value is disabled. When advanced accounting is enabled, the Shared Ethernet Adapter keeps track of the hardware (MAC) addresses of all of the packets it receives from the LPAR clients, and increments packet and byte counts for each client independently. After advanced accounting is enabled on the Shared Ethernet Adapter, the VIOS administrator can generate a report to view per-client statistics by running the seastat command.    Advanced accounting must be enabled on the Shared Ethernet Adapter before the seastat command can print any statistics. To enable advanced accounting on the SEA, enter the following command:  chdev -dev <SEA device name> -attr accounting=enabled   FlagsFlag name Description -d Shared Ethernet Adapter device name Specifies the device name of the Shared Ethernet Adapter. -n  Disables name resolution on the IP addresses. -c  Clears all of the per client Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics that have been gathered. -s searchtype=value Searchs for a specified value.   Exit Status The following exit values are returned: Return code Description 0 Successful completion. >0 Invalid flag, argument, or command failure   Examples To display Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics for sea0, type: seastat -d sea0    To clear the Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics for sea0, type: seastat -d sea0 -c To search a MAC address, type:seastat -d entX -s mac=XXXXXX To search for a vlan, type:seastat -d entX -s vlan=<0 to 4094> Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 snmp_info command Purpose Requests or modifies values of Management Information Base (MIB) variables managed by a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent.   Syntax snmp_info [ get | next] [] [ Community] [ Level] [ HostName] [ ObjectFile] [ Tries] [ ] Variable.Instance  The following syntax is for the set option:  snmp_info  set [] [ Community] [ Level] [ HostName] [ ObjectFile] [ Tries] [ ] Variable.Instance=Value  The following syntax is for the dump option:  snmp_info  dump [] [ Community] [ Level] [ HostName] [ ObjectFile] [ Tries] [ ] [Variable.Instance]   Description The  command requests or modifies values for one or more Management Information Base (MIB) variables managed by a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent. This command may only be issued by a user with root privileges or by a member of the system group.   If you specify the get option, the  command requests information about one or more MIB variables from an SNMP agent.  If you specify the next option, the  command requests information from an SNMP agent about the instances following the specified instances. The next option makes it possible to obtain MIB values without knowledge of the instance qualifiers.   If you specify the set option, the  command modifies values for  one or more MIB variables for an SNMP agent. Only a few MIB variables are designated read-write. The agent that manages the MIB database may  take various actions as a side effect of modifying MIB variables. For example, setting the ifAdminStatus MIB variable to 2 will normally shut down a network interface. The action taken is determined by the implementation of the SNMP agent that manages the database.  If you specify the dump option, the  command can be used to traverse the entire MIB tree of a given agent. If a group is passed in as the Variable parameter, the  command will traverse that specified path of the MIB tree.  The  command has a debug facility that dumps the debug information for transmitted and received packets. The facility is enabled with the -debug flag.   Flags Flag name Description -com Community  Specifies the community name to be used to query. If you do not specify this flag, the default community name is public. -debug Level  Specifies the level of I/O debug information. Use one of the following values: 0 No debug information. 1 Port bindings and the number of bytes transmitted and received. 2 Level 1 plus a hexadecimal dump of incoming and outgoing packets. 3 Level 2 plus an English version of the request and response packets.  If you do not specify this flag, the default debug level is 0. -host HostName  Specifies the host name of the SNMP agent to be queried. If you do not specify this flag, the default host name is the host name of the system on which the user is currently logged. -file ObjectFile Specifies the name of the objects definition file. If you do not specify this flag, the default objects definition file name is /etc/mib.defs. -mode Option  Specifies the mode by which to access the MIB variables.  The value can be one of the following options: get Requests information about the specified MIB variables next Requests the instances following the specified instances set Modifies the specified write access MIB variables dump Dumps the specified section of the MIB tree    The option name can be specified by the minimum number of characters required to make it unique. If you do not specify this flag, the default mode is get. -retry Tries Specifies the number of times the  command transmits the SNMP request to the SNMP agent before ending with the message no SNMP response. If you do not specify this flag, the default number of tries is 3. -verbose  Specifies that the output from the  command be displayed in verbose mode. If you do not specify this flag, the information will not be displayed in verbose mode. -wait  Specifies the wait time in seconds for the response from the snmpd agent. If you do not specify this flag, the default wait time is 15 seconds.   Parameters Parameter Description Value Specifies the value to which the MIB Variable parameter is to be set. A value must be specified for each variable. If a value is not specified, the request packet will be invalid. Variable Specifies the name in text format or numeric format of a specific MIB variable as defined in the /etc/mib.defs file. If the option to the -mode flag is next or dump, the Variable parameter may be specified as a MIB group.  Instance Specifies the instance qualifier for the MIB Variable parameter.  The Instance parameter is required if the option to the -mode flag is  get or set. The Instance parameter is optional if the option to  the -mode flag is next or dump.   There should be no blank spaces in the Variable.Instance parameter sequence.  If the Instance parameter is not specified, do not place a period after the Variable parameter.  For further information, consult RFC 1213, which defines the Management Information Base (MIB) for network management, and RFC 1157, which defines the SNMP protocol for creating requests for MIB information and formatting responses.

 traceroute command Purpose Prints the route that IP packets take to a network host.   Syntax traceroute [  Hops ] [  ] [  Port ] [  Address ] Host [ PacketSize ]   Description The traceroute command attempts to trace the route an IP packet follows to an Internet host by launching UDP probe packets with a small maximum time-to-live (Hops parameter), then listening for an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from gateways along the way. Probes are started with a Hops value of one hop, which is increased one hop at a time until an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message is returned. The ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message indicates either that the host has been located or the command has reached the maximum number of hops allowed for the trace.  The traceroute command sends three probes at each Hops setting to record the following: Hops value Address of the gateway Round-trip time of each successful probe    If the probe answers come from different gateways, the command prints the address of each responding system. If there is no response from a probe within a 3-second time-out interval, an * (asterisk) is printed for that probe.   The traceroute command is intended for use in network testing, measurement, and management. It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation. Because of the load it imposes on the network, the traceroute command should not be used during normal operations or from automated scripts.  The traceroute command prints an ! (exclamation mark) after the round-trip time if the Hops value is one hop or less. A maximum time-to-live value of one hop or less generally indicates an incompatibility in the way ICMP replies are handled by different network software. The incompatibility can usually be resolved by doubling the last Hops value used and trying again.  Other possible annotations after the round-trip notation are as follows: !H Host unreachable !N Network unreachable !P Protocol unreachable !S Source route failed !F Fragmentation needed  If the majority of probes result in an error, the traceroute command exits.  The only mandatory parameter for the traceroute command is the destination host name or IP number. The traceroute command will determine the length of the probe packet based on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the outgoing interface. The UDP probe packets are set to an unlikely value so as to prevent processing by the destination host.   Flags Flag name Description -hops Max_ttl Sets the maximum time-to-live (maximum number of hops) used in outgoing probe packets. The default is 30 hops (the same default used for TCP connections). -num Prints hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numerically. This flag saves a name-server address-to-name lookup for each gateway found on the path. -port Port Sets the base UDP port number used in probes. The default is 33434. The traceroute command depends on an open UDP port range of base to base + nhops - 1 at the destination host. If a UDP port is not available, this option can be used to pick an unused port range. -src SRC_Addr Uses the next IP address in numerical form as the source address in outgoing probe packets. On hosts with more than one IP address, the -src flag can be used to force the source address to be something other than the IP address of the interface on which the probe packet is sent. If the next IP address is not one of the machine's interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent.   Parameters Parameter Description Host Specifies the destination host, either by host name or IP number. This parameter is required. PacketSize Specifies the probe datagram length. The default packet size is determined by the traceroute command based on the MTU of the outgoing interface.   Exit Status See .   Examples To print the route to host nis.nfs.net, type: traceroute nis.nsf.net The output will look similar to the following: traceroute to rotterdam (35.1.1.48), 30 hops max, 56 byte packet 1 helios.ee.lbl.gov (128.3.112.1) 19 ms 19 ms 0 ms 2 lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1) 39 ms 39 ms 19 ms 3 lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1) 39 ms 39 ms 19 ms 4 ccngw-ner-cc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.136.23) 39 ms 40 ms 39 ms 5 ccn-nerif22.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.168.22) 39 ms 39 ms 39 ms 6 128.32.197.4 (128.32.197.4) 40 ms 59 ms 59 ms 7 131.119.2.5 (131.119.2.5) 59 ms 59 ms 59 ms 8 129.140.70.13 (129.140.70.13) 99 ms 99 ms 80 ms 9 129.140.71.6 (129.140.71.6) 139 ms 239 ms 319 ms 10 129.140.81.7 (129.140.81.7) 220 ms 199 ms 199 ms 11 nic.merit.edu (35.1.1.48) 239 ms 239 ms 239 ms   Related Information The  command and the  command.

 migratepv command Purpose Moves allocated physical partitions from one physical volume to one or more other physical volumes.   Syntax migratepv [  LogicalVolume] SourcePhysicalVolume DestinationPhysicalVolume ...   Description The migratepv command moves allocated physical partitions and the data they contain from the SourcePhysicalVolume to one or more other physical volumes, DestinationPhysicalVolume.  All physical volumes must be within the same volume group. The specified source physical volume cannot be included in the list of DestinationPhysicalVolume parameters.   The allocation of the new physical partitions follows the policies defined for the logical volumes that contain the physical partitions being moved.  If you specify a logical volume that contains the boot image, the migratepv -lv command attempts to find enough contiguous partitions on one of the target physical volumes. If the migration is successful, the migratepv command will indicate a change in the boot device as well as the new boot physical volume. The attempted migration fails if the migratepv -lv command is unable to find enough contiguous space to satisfy the request.   All logical volume manager migration functions work by creating a mirror of the logical volumes involved, then resynchronizing the logical volumes. The original logical volume is then removed. If the migratepv command is used to move a logical volume containing the primary dump device, the system will not have an accessible primary dump device during the execution of the command. Therefore, a dump taken during this execution may fail.   Flags Flag name Description -lv Moves only the physical partitions allocated to the specified logical volume and located on the specified source physical volume.   Exit Status Return code Description 8 The physical volume is not assigned to a volume group   Examples To move physical partitions from hdisk1 to hdisk6 and hdisk7, type: migratepv hdisk1 hdisk6 hdisk7 Physical partitions are moved from one physical volume to two others within the same volume group. To move physical partitions in logical volume lv02 from hdisk1 to hdisk6, type: migratepv -lv lv02 hdisk1 hdisk6 Only those physical partitions contained in lv02 are moved from one physical volume to another.

 alt_root_vg command PurposeCreates a copy of (clones) the currently running system to an alternative disk.   Syntaxalt_root_vg [] [] [  ]     DescriptionThe alt_root_vg command allows users to copy the current root volume group to an alternate disk and to update the operating system to the next fix pack level, without taking the machine down for an extended period of time and mitigating outage risk. This can be done by creating a copy of the current rootvg on an alternate disk and simultaneously applying fix pack updates. If needed, the bootlist command can be run after the new disk has been booted, and the bootlist can be changed to boot back to the older  level of the operating system.  The target_disk cannot be a physical volume that is assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition). Cloning the running rootvg, allows the user to create a backup copy of  the root volume group. This copy can be used as a back up in case the rootvg failed, or it can be modified by installing additional updates.  One scenario might be to clone a 1.3.0.0 system, and then install  updates to bring the cloned rootvg to 1.3.0.0-FP8.0. This would update the system while it was still running. Rebooting from the new rootvg would  bring the level of the running system to 1.3.0.0-FP8.0. If there was a  problem with this level, changing the bootlist back to the 1.3.0.0 disk  and rebooting would bring the system back to 1.3.0.0. Other scenarios  would include cloning the rootvg and applying individual fixes,  rebooting the system and testing those fixes, and rebooting back to the  original rootvg if there was a problem. At the end of the installation, a volume group, altinst_rootvg, is left on the target disks in the varied off state as a placeholder. If varied on, it indicates that it owns no logical volumes; however, the volume  group does contain logical volumes, but they have been removed from the  Object Data Manager (ODM) because their names now conflict with the names of the logical  volumes on the running system. Do not vary on the altinst_rootvg volume  group; instead, leave the definition there as a placeholder. After rebooting from the new alternate disk, the former rootvg volume group is displayed in a lspv listing as old_rootvg, and it includes all disks in the original rootvg. This former rootvg volume group is set to not vary-on at reboot. If a return to the original rootvg is necessary, the bootlist command  is used to reboot from the original rootvg.   FlagsFlag name Description -target  Specifies a space-delimited list of the name or names of the target disks where the alternate rootvg clone is created. These disks must not contain any volume group definitions. The lspv command shows these disks because they belong to the None volume group. -bundle  Specifies the path name of an optional file that contains a list of packages or filesets that are installed after a rootvg clone is created. You must also specify the -location flag when you specify the bundle option.  -location  Specifies the location of the installp images or updates to apply after a clone of rootvg is created. The location can be a directory and full-path name or device name, such as /dev/rmt0. -g Skips checks to ensure the disk can boot. -z Specifies that no types of non-rootvg volume groups are to be imported. Exit StatusSee .   ExamplesTo create a boot list of logical devices to be used in the next normal boot, enter the following commands: alt_root_vg -target hdisk2 -bundle my_bundle -location /tmp/update alt_root_vg -target hdisk2 -bundle my_bundle -location /home/padmin   Related InformationThe  command.

 chvg command Purpose Sets the characteristics of a volume group.   Syntax chvg   [] [ | ] [ <num> [-chksize] VolumeGroup   Description The chvg command changes the characteristics of a volume group.   Flags Flag name Description -resume Resumes normal I/O operations for a volume group. -suspend Drains I/O's for this volume group and suspends future I/O's. -unlock Unlocks the volume group. This option is provided if the volume group is left in a locked state by abnormal termination of another LVM operation (such as the command core dumping, or the system crashing).  Before using the -unlock flag, make sure that the volume group is not being used by another LVM command.   Changes the limit of the number of physical partitions per physical volume, specified by factor. factor should be between 1-16 for 32 disk volume groups and 1-64 for 128 disk volume groups.    If factor is not supplied, it is set to the lowest value such that the number of physical partitions in the volume group is less than factor x1016. If factor is specified, the maximum number of physical partitions per physical volume for the volume group changes to factor x1016.  Examines all the disks in the volume group to determine if they have grown in size. This option does not support resizing a volume group while it is activated in classic or enhanced concurrent mode. This option does not support resizing the rootvg volume group. If any disks have grown in size, this option attempts to add additional physical partitions to the physical volume. If necessary, this option determines the appropriate 1016 multiplier and conversion to big volume group.  After running chvg -chksize, it might be necessary to run the deactivatevg, followed by running the activatevg command on the volume group to see the change of size of the disks.   Exit Status See .   Examples To suspend the volume group vg03, type: chvg -suspend vg03 To resume the volume group vg03, type: chvg -resume vg03 To change the number of physical partitions per physical volume by 4, type: chvg -factor 4 testvg To determine whether the testvg volume group has grown in size after adding additional physical partitions to the physical volumes in the group, type:chvg -chksize testvg   Related Information The  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, and the  command.

 exportvg command Purpose Exports the definition of a volume group from a set of physical volumes.   Syntax exportvg VolumeGroup   Description The exportvg command removes the definition of the volume group specified by the VolumeGroup parameter from the system. The primary use of the exportvg command, coupled with the importvg command, is to allow portable volumes to be exchanged between systems. Only a complete volume group can be exported, not individual physical volumes.  Using the exportvg command and the importvg command, you can also switch ownership of data on physical volumes shared between two processors.  Mount points longer than 128 characters will not automatically be re-mounted when the volume group is imported using the importvg command and should not be used.   A volume group that has a paging space volume on it cannot be exported.   Exit Status See .   Examples To remove volume group vg02 from the system, type: exportvg vg02   The volume group must be deactivated before exporting.   The definition of vg02 is removed from the system and the volume group cannot be accessed.   Restrictions Mount points longer than 128 characters should not be used.

 extendvg command Purpose Adds physical volumes to a volume group.   Syntax extendvg   [   ] VolumeGroup PhysicalVolume ...   Description The extendvg command increases the size of volume group by adding one or more physical volumes. The physical volume is checked to verify that it is not already in another volume group. If the system determines the physical volume belongs to a volume group that is activated, it exits. But if the system detects a description area from a volume group that is not activated, it prompts you for confirmation while continuing with the command. The previous contents of the physical volume are lost, so you must be cautious when using the override function.   Flags Flag name Description -f Forces the physical volume to be added to the specified volume group unless the following conditions are true:The physical volume is a member of another volume group in the device configuration database. The physical volume is a member of the another volume group that is active. The physical volume is assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).    Exit Status See .

 importvg command Purpose Imports a new volume group definition from a set of physical volumes.   Syntax importvg [  VolumeGroup ] PhysicalVolume   Description The importvg command makes the previously exported volume group known to the system.  The PhysicalVolume parameter specifies only one physical volume to identify the volume group; any remaining physical volumes (those belonging to the same volume group) are found by the importvg command and included in the import. An imported volume group is automatically activated. When a volume group with file systems is imported, the /etc/filesystems file is updated with values for the new logical volumes and mount points.    After importing the volume group, you must run the fsck command before the file systems can be mounted. Care should be taken to avoid using mount point longer than 128 characters as the mount point information would be missing from the LVCB (logical volume control block) if it is longer than 128 characters. In this case, the importvg command will not be able to update the /etc/filesystems file with the stanza for the newly imported logical volume.  The importvg command changes the name of a logical volume if the name already exists in the system. It prints a message and the new name to standard error, and updates the /etc/filesystems file to include the new logical volume name.   Flags Flag name Description -vg VolumeGroup Specifies the name to use for the new volume group. If this flag is not used, the system automatically generates a new name. The volume group name can only contain the following characters: "A" through "Z," "a" through "z," "0" through "9," or "_" (the underscore), "-" (the minus sign), or "." (the period). All other characters are considered invalid.   Exit Status See .   Examples To import the volume group bkvg from physical volume hdisk07, type: importvg -vg bkvg hdisk07  The volume group bkvg is made known to the system.

 mirrorios command Purpose Mirrors all the logical volumes on rootvg.   Syntax mirrorios [PhysicalVolume ...]   Description The mirrorios command takes all the logical volumes on the rootvg volume group and mirrors those logical volumes. The target physical drives must already be members of the volume group.  The mirrorios command attempts to mirror the logical volumes onto any of the disks in a volume group. To control which drives are used for mirroring, you must include the list of disks in the input parameters, PhysicalVolume. Mirror strictness is enforced. The mirrorios command mirrors the logical volumes, using the default settings of the logical volume being mirrored.   For best results, mirror the rootvg volume group on all   partitions.

 mkvg command Purpose Creates a volume group.   Syntax mkvg   [   ][  VolumeGroup ] PhysicalVolume ...   Description The mkvg command creates a new volume group using the physical volumes represented by the PhysicalVolume parameter. After creating the volume group, the mkvg command automatically activates the new volume group using the activatevg command.   The physical volume is checked to verify that it is not already in another volume group. If the system believes the physical volume belongs to a volume group that is active, it exits. But if the system detects a description area from a volume group that is not active, it prompts the user for confirmation in continuing with the command. The previous contents of the physical volume are lost, so the user must be cautious when using the override function.  This command will fail to add a disk to the volume group if the disk indicates that it is managed by a third party volume manager. The physical volume that you specify cannot be assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).     Flags Flag name Description -f Forces the volume group to be created on the specified physical volume unless the physical volume is part of another volume group in the Device Configuration Database or a volume group that is active. -vg VolumeGroup Specifies the volume group name rather than having the name generated automatically. Volume group names must be unique system wide and can range from 1 to 15 characters. The name cannot begin with a prefix already defined in the PdDv class in the Device Configuration database for other devices. The volume group name created is sent to standard output.  The volume group name can only contain the following characters: "A" through "Z," "a" through "z," "0" through "9," or "_" (the underscore), "-" (the minus sign), or "." (the period). All other characters are considered invalid.   Exit Status See .

 redefvg command Purpose Redefines the set of physical volumes of the given volume group in the device configuration database.   Syntax redefvg {   Device |    Vgid } VolumeGroup   Description During normal operations, the device configuration database remains consistent with the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) information in the reserved area on the physical volumes. If inconsistencies occur between the device configuration database and the LVM, the redefvg command determines which physical volumes belong to the specified volume group and enters this information in the device configuration database. The redefvg command checks for inconsistencies by reading the reserved areas of all the configured physical volumes attached to the system.   Flags Flag name Description -dev Device The volume group ID, Vgid, is read from the specified physical volume device.  You can specify the Vgid of any physical volume belonging to the volume group that you are redefining. -vgid Vgid The volume group identification number of the volume group to be redefined.

 reducevg command Purpose Removes physical volumes from a volume group. When all physical volumes are removed from the volume group, the volume group is deleted.    Syntax reducevg [  ]  [  ]VolumeGroup PhysicalVolume ...   Description The reducevg command removes one or more physical volumes represented by the PhysicalVolume parameter from the VolumeGroup. When you remove all physical volumes in a volume group, the volume group is also removed.   Sometimes a disk is removed from the system without first running the reducevg command. The VGDA still has this removed disk in its memory, but the PhysicalVolume name no longer exists or has been reassigned. To remove references to this missing disk you can still use reducevg, but with the Physical Volume ID (PVID) instead of the disk name: reducevg VolumeGroup PVID. The specified physical volume cannot contain a logical volume that is assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).   Flags Flag name Description -f Removes the requirement for user confirmation when the -rmlv flag is used. -rmlv Deallocates the existing logical volume partitions and then deletes resultant empty logical volumes from the specified physical volumes. User confirmation is required unless the -f flag is added.  The reducevg command with the -rmlv flag automatically deletes all logical volume data on the physical volume before removing the physical volume from the volume group. If a logical volume spans multiple physical volumes, the removal of any of those physical volumes may jeopardize the integrity of the entire logical volume.   Exit Status See .   Examples To remove physical volume hdisk1 from volume group vg01, type: reducevg vg01 hdisk1 To remove physical volume hdisk1 and all residing logical volumes from volume group vg01 without  user confirmation, type:   The reducevg command with the -rmlv flag  automatically deletes all logical volume data before removing the physical volume.   reducevg -rmlv -f vg01 hdisk1 The physical volume hdisk1 and all residing logical volumes are removed.

 syncvg command Purpose Synchronizes logical volume copies that are not current.   Syntax syncvg {  |  |  } Name ...   Description The syncvg command synchronizes the physical partitions, which are copies of the original physical partition, that are not current. The syncvg command can be used with logical volumes, physical volumes, or volume groups, with the Name parameter representing the logical volume name, physical volume name, or volume group name.  Unless disabled, the copies within a volume group are synchronized automatically when the volume group is activated by the activatevg command.   For the sycnvg command to be successful, at least one good copy of the logical volume should be accessible, and the physical volumes that contains this copy should be in ACTIVE state.   The syncvg command will check for the NUM_PARALLEL_LPS environment variable. The value of NUM_PARALLEL_LPS will be used to set the number of logical partitions to be synchronized in parallel.   Flags Flag name Description -lv Specifies that the Name parameter represents a logical volume device name. -pv Specifies that the Name parameter represents a physical volume device name. -vg Specifies that the Name parameter represents a volume group device name.

Thin provisioning helps reduce the amount of unused storage allocated to applications or users. Thick provisioning helps reserve storage space for virtual disks, thus ensuring that there are no failures because of lack of storage space. With N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV), you can configure the managed system so that multiple logical partitions can access independent physical storage through the same physical Fibre Channel adapter.  A shared storage pool provides distributed storage access to all   logical partitions in the cluster. Each cluster consists of one  VIOS logical partition.  You can assign priorities to partitions and the hypervisor allocates processing power as needed by the applications. This feature allows for automatic nondisruptive balancing of processing power between logical partitions assigned to shared pools resulting in increased throughput and the potential to reduce processor-based software licensing costs. This feature is supported on  and  processor-based servers.  A running  logical partition can be suspended along with its operating system and applications. When a logical partition is suspended, the state of the logical partition is saved on persistent storage, and the server resources that were in use by that logical partition are made available for use by other logical partitions. At a later time, the operation of the suspended logical partition and its applications can be resumed. Trusted Boot is a feature of PowerSC and you can enable Trusted Boot in PowerVM.

 Single root I/O virtualization Single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) is a Peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) standard architecture that define extensions to PCIe specifications to enable multiple logical partitions running simultaneously within a system to share PCIe devices. The architecture define virtual replicas of PCI functions known as virtual functions (VF). A Logical partition can connect directly to an SR-IOV adapter VF without going through a virtual intermediary (VI) such as a  or . This provides for a low latency and lower CPU utilization alternative by avoiding a VI. SR-IOV capable adapter might be assigned to a logical partition in a dedicated or shared mode. The management console provides an interface to enable SR-IOV adapter in a shared mode. An SR-IOV capable adapter in a shared mode is assigned to the  for management of the adapter and provisioning of adapter resources to logical partitions. The management console, in conjunction with the , provides the ability to mange the adapter's physical Ethernet ports and logical ports. To connect a logical partition to an SR-IOV Ethernet adapter VF, create an SR-IOV Ethernet logical port for the logical partition. When you create an Ethernet logical port for a partition, select the adapter physical Ethernet port to connect to the logical partition and specify the resource requirements for the logical port. Each logical partition can have one or more logical ports from each SR-IOV adapter in shared mode. The number of logical ports for all configured logical partitions cannot exceed the adapter logical port limit. To create an SR-IOV Ethernet logical port for a logical partition, use one of the following methods: Create an Ethernet logical port when you create a partition. Add an Ethernet logical port to a partition profile, shutdown the logical partition, and reactivate the logical partition by using the partition profile. Add an Ethernet logical port to a running logical partition by using dynamic partitioning. An SR-IOV adapter does not support  unless the VF is assigned to a shared Ethernet adapter. When you activate a logical partition, the logical ports in the partition profile are considered to be a required resource. If the physical adapter resources required by the logical port are not available, the logical partition cannot be activated. However, logical ports can be removed dynamically from other logical partition to make the required resources available to the logical partition that is activated. For an SR-IOV adapter in shared mode, the physical port switch mode can be configured in Virtual Ethernet Bridge (VEB) or Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) mode. If the switch mode is configured in VEB mode, the traffic between the logical ports are not visible to the external switch. If the switch mode is configured in VEPA mode, the traffic between logical ports must be routed back to the physical port by the external switch. Before enabling the physical port switch in VEPA mode, ensure that the switch attached to the physical port is supported and is enabled for reflective relay. When you create an Ethernet logical port, you can select a promiscuous permission to allow the logical port to be configured as a promiscuous logical port by the logical partition. A promiscuous logical port receives all unicast traffic with a destination address that does not match the address of one of the other logical ports configured for the same physical port. The number of logical ports configured for logical partitions, active or shutdown, on a physical port will be limited to minimize potential performance impact due to overhead associated with promiscuous logical ports. The management console indicates the number of logical ports on the physical port that are allowed to have a promiscuous permission setting. When bridging between virtual Ethernet adapters and a physical Ethernet adapter, an SR-IOV Ethernet logical port might be used as the physical Ethernet adapter to access the outside network. When a logical port is configured as the physical Ethernet adapter for bridging, the logical port must have the promiscuous permission enabled. For example, if you create a logical port for a  logical partition and to use the logical port as the physical adapter for the shared Ethernet adapter, you must select the promiscuous permission for the logical port. Configuration requirements Consider the following configuration requirements when an Ethernet logical port is used as the physical Ethernet device for shared Ethernet adapter bridging: When there is a requirement to divert all network traffic to flow through an external switch, consider the following requirements:The  virtual switch must be set to the VEPA switching mode and the SR-IOV Ethernet adapter physical port switch mode must also be set to the VEPA switching mode. In addition, the logical port is the only logical port configured for the physical port. When you create an Ethernet logical port you can also specify a capacity value. The capacity value specifies the desired capacity of the logical port as a percentage of the capability of the physical port. The capacity level value determines the amount of resources that are assigned to the logical port from the physical port. The assigned resources determine the minimum capability of the logical port. The physical port resources that are not used by other logical ports might be temporarily used by the logical port when the logical port exceeds its assigned resources to allow additional capability. System or network limitations can influence the amount of throughput a logical port can actually achieve. The maximum capacity that can be assigned to a logical port is 100%. The sum of the capacity values for all the configured logical ports on a physical port must be less than or equal to 100%. To minimize the configuration effort while adding additional logical ports, you can reserve some of the physical port capacity for additional logical ports. When an Ethernet logical port is used as a physical adapter for bridging virtual Ethernet adapters, the parameter values such as the number of client virtual adapters and expected throughput must be considered when choosing a capacity value.  The Ethernet logical ports allow the logical port to run diagnostics on the adapter and physical port. Select this permission only while running the diagnostics by using the logical port. I/O adapters that are configured to run in Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) mode are managed by system firmware and adapter firmware. Both system firmware and adapter firmware for the SR-IOV adapter are downloaded with the normal system firmware updates, but must be manually applied to the system and adapter by using the Hardware Management Console (HMC) command line.

 Updating the SR-IOV adapter firmware I/O adapters that are configured to run in Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) mode are managed by system firmware and adapter firmware. Both system firmware and adapter firmware for the SR-IOV adapter are downloaded with the normal system firmware updates, but must be manually applied to the system and adapter by using the Hardware Management Console (HMC) command line. The system firmware that supports SR-IOV adapters includes the system firmware that is used for configuring and managing the adapter and the I/O adapter firmware. These types of SR-IOV firmware are automatically updated to the current level of the adapter firmware that is available when the adapter is configured to run in SR-IOV mode.  They are also updated automatically during maintenance operations, such as when the adapter is stopped or replaced. The update process for the SR-IOV adapters is similar to the update process of other system firmware. If you update the overall system firmware, the system firmware update might contain system firmware for the SR-IOV adapters, adapter firmware updates, or both. Adapters that are configured in SR-IOV mode are not updated automatically to use the new firmware updates, because of a temporary I/O outage that occurs when the firmware is updated. This outage lasts approximately 30 seconds when you update only the system firmware, and approximately 2.5 minutes when you update both the system firmware and the adapter firmware.  You can manually activate the available SR-IOV firmware updates by using the HMC command line. To activate firmware updates, complete the following steps: This procedure only applies to the following IBMÂ® POWER7Â® processor-based servers:IBM PowerÂ® 770 () IBM Power 780 ()  ()  startdump -m system_name -t resource -r "sriovdebug -fwinfo"  The output is sent to a dump file in the  directory that is titled . The contents of the file contains a section of information for each adapter that is running in SR-IOV mode. The section for each adapter is identified by its . Use the following list to determine the state of the updates for each adapter that is listed.No updates are available for an adapter when the following conditions are met:There is text at the end of the command output for that adapter that states there are no adapter system firmware updates for the adapter in the specified location. The version number that is displayed in the Current Version running output for that adapter is the same as the version number that is displayed in the Adjunct Firmware image output for that adapter. System adapter firmware updates are available for an adapter when the text at the end of the command output for the adapter states that there are system adapter firmware updates for the adapter in the specified location. Adapter firmware updates are available for an adapter when the value of the Current version running for that adapter is not the same as the value of the Adjunct Firmware image for that adapter. If updates are available, you can update the system firmware and the adapter firmware or only the system firmware. You can also update all of the adapters at the same time, or specify a single adapter to update.  To update the system firmware and the adapter firmware for an SR-IOV adapter, enter one of the following commands. Updating the system firmware and the adapter firmware results in a nominal 2.5 minute I/O outage of the adapter during the update. startdump -m system_name -t resource -r "sriov all updateadapter"This command updates the system firmware and adapter firmware for all of the adapters. startdump -m system_name -t resource -r "sriov slot_location_code updateadapter"This command updates the system firmware and adapter firmware only for the adapter that is specified by the slot_location_code parameter. To update only the system firmware for the selected SR-IOV adapter or for all of your SR-IOV adapters, enter one of the following commands. Updating only the system firmware results in a nominal 30 second I/O outage for the adapter during the update.startdump -m system_name -t resource -r "sriov slot_location_code update"This command updates only the system firmware for the adapter that is specified by the slot_location_code parameter. startdump -m system_name -t resource -r "sriov all update"This command updates only the system firmware for all of the adapters.  startdump -m system_name -t resource -r "sriovdebug -fwinfo"  The output is sent to a dump file in the  directory that is titled . The contents of the file contains a section of information for each adapter that is running in SR-IOV mode. The section for each adapter is identified by its . The output of the command displays the updated information about the SR-IOV adapters. Depending on which firmware you updated, the adapters with the updated firmware satisfy either the criteria of no available updates or the criterion of having only available adapter firmware updates. These criteria are shown in step . Parent topic:          
 Virtual networking Learn about virtual Ethernet, , link aggregation, ,  failover, and VLAN. Virtual Ethernet technology facilitates IP-based communication between logical partitions on the same system by using software switch systems that are capable of virtual local area networks (VLANs). Using  technology, logical partitions can communicate with other systems outside the hardware unit without assigning physical Ethernet slots to the logical partitions. Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the next generation of Internet Protocol and is gradually replacing the current Internet standard, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). The key IPv6 enhancement is the expansion of the IP address space from 32 bits to 128 bits, providing virtually unlimited, unique IP addresses. Virtual Ethernet adapters allow client logical partitions to send and receive network traffic without having a physical Ethernet adapter. Virtual local area networks (VLAN) allow the physical network to be logically segmented. With Shared Ethernet Adapters on the  logical partition, virtual Ethernet adapters on client logical partitions can send and receive outside network traffic. Single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) is a Peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) standard architecture that define extensions to PCIe specifications to enable multiple logical partitions running simultaneously within a system to share PCIe devices. The architecture define virtual replicas of PCI functions known as virtual functions (VF).

 Unlike most other types of I/O devices, you can never assign the HEA itself to a logical partition. Instead, multiple logical partitions can connect directly to the HEA and use the HEA resources. This allows these logical partitions to access external networks through the HEA without having to go through an Ethernet bridge on another logical partition. To connect a logical partition to an HEA, you must create a logical  (LHEA) for the logical partition. A logical  (LHEA) is a representation of a physical HEA on a logical partition. An LHEA appears to the operating system as if it were a physical Ethernet adapter, just as a virtual Ethernet adapter appears as if it were a physical Ethernet adapter. When you create an LHEA for a logical partition, you specify the resources that the logical partition can use on the actual physical HEA. Each logical partition can have one LHEA for each physical HEA on the managed system. Each LHEA can have one or more logical ports, and each logical port can connect to a physical port on the HEA. You can create an LHEA for a logical partition using either of the following methods: You can add the LHEA to a partition profile, shut down the logical partition, and reactivate the logical partition using the partition profile with the LHEA. You can add the LHEA to a running logical partition using dynamic partitioning. This method can be used for  logical partitions only if you install the following operating systems on the logical partition:  version 4.6, or later  version 5.1, or later  Version 10, or later  Version 11, or later When you activate a logical partition, the LHEAs in the partition profile are considered to be required resources. If the physical HEA resources required by the LHEAs are not available, then the logical partition cannot be activated. However, when the logical partition is active, you can remove any LHEAs you want from the logical partition.  After you create an LHEA for a logical partition, a network device is created in the logical partition. This network device is named  ethX on  logical partitions, where X represents sequentially assigned numbers. The user can then set up TCP/IP configuration like a physical Ethernet device to communicate with other logical partitions. You can configure a logical partition so that it is the only logical partition that can access a physical port of an HEA by specifying promiscuous mode for an LHEA that is assigned to the logical partition. When an LHEA is in promiscuous mode, no other logical partitions can access the logical ports of the physical port that is associated with the LHEA that is in promiscuous mode. You might want to configure a logical partition to promiscuous mode in the following situations: If you want to connect more than 16 logical partitions to each other and to an external network through a physical port on an HEA, you can create a logical port on a Virtual I/O Server and configure an Ethernet bridge between the logical port and a virtual Ethernet adapter on a virtual LAN. This allows all logical partitions with virtual Ethernet adapters on the virtual LAN to communicate with the physical port through the Ethernet bridge. If you configure an Ethernet bridge between a logical port and a virtual Ethernet adapter, the physical port that is connected to the logical port must have the following properties:The physical port must be configured so that the Virtual I/O Server is the promiscuous mode logical partition for the physical port. The physical port can have only one logical port. You want the logical partition to have dedicated access to a physical port. You want to use tools such as tcpdump or iptrace. A logical port can communicate with all other logical ports that are connected to the same physical port on the HEA. The physical port and its associated logical ports form a logical Ethernet network. Broadcast and multicast packets are distributed on this logical network as though it was a physical Ethernet network. You can connect up to 16 logical ports to a physical port using this logical network. By extension, you can connect up to 16 logical partitions to each other and to an external network through this logical network. The actual number of logical ports that you can connect to a physical port depends upon the Multi-Core Scaling value of the physical port group. It also depends on the number of logical ports that have been created for other physical ports within the physical port group. By default, the Multi-Core Scaling value of each physical port group is set to 4, which allows four logical ports to be connected to the physical ports in the physical port group. To allow up to 16 logical ports to be connected to the physical ports in the physical port group, you must change the Multi-Core Scaling value of the physical port group to 1 and restart the managed system.  You can set each logical port to restrict or allow packets that are tagged for specific VLANs. You can set a logical port to accept packets with any VLAN ID, or you can set a logical port to accept only the VLAN IDs that you specify. You can specify up to 20 individual VLAN IDs for each logical port.  The physical ports on an HEA are always configured on the managed system level. If you use an  to manage a system, you must use the  to configure the physical ports on any HEAs belonging to the managed system. Also, the physical port configuration applies to all logical partitions that use the physical port. (Some properties might require setup in the operating system as well. For example, the maximum packet size for a physical port on the HEA must be set on the managed system level using the . However, you must also set the maximum packet size for each logical port within the operating system.) By contrast, if a system is unpartitioned and is not managed by an , you can configure the physical ports on an HEA within the operating system as if the physical ports were ports on a regular physical Ethernet adapter. HEA hardware does not support half duplex mode.  You can change the properties of a logical port on an LHEA by using dynamic partitioning to remove the logical port from the logical partition. You can also add the logical port back to the logical partition using the changed properties. If the operating system of the logical partition does not support dynamic partitioning for LHEAs, and you want to change any logical port property other than the VLANs on which the logical port participates, you must set a partition profile for the logical partition so that the partition profile contains the wanted logical port properties, shut down the logical partition, and activate the logical partition using the new or changed partition profile.  If the operating system of the logical partition does not support dynamic partitioning for LHEAs, and you want to change the VLANs on which the logical port participates, you must remove the logical port from a partition profile belonging to the logical partition, shut down and activate the logical partition using the changed partition profile, add the logical port back to the partition profile using the changed VLAN configuration, and shut down and activate the logical partition again using the changed partition profile.

 Link aggregation or Etherchannel devices For example, ent0 and ent1 adapters can be aggregated to the ent3 adapter. The system considers these aggregated adapters as one adapter, and all adapters in the link aggregation device are given the same hardware address. Therefore, they are treated by remote systems as if they were one adapter. Link aggregation can provide increased redundancy because individual links might fail. The link aggregation device can automatically fail over to another adapter in the device to maintain connectivity. For example, if the ent0 adapter fails, the packets are automatically sent on the next available adapter, ent1, without disruption to existing user connections. The ent0 adapter automatically returns to service on the link aggregation device when it recovers. You can configure a  to use a link aggregation, or Etherchannel, device as the physical adapter.

 Multipath I/O View Multipath I/O (MPIO) information for client logical partitions. Multiple virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) or adapters in a client logical partition can access the same disk through multiple  logical partitions. This section describes a virtual SCSI multipath device configuration. If correctly configured, the client recognizes the disk as a multipath device. If you are using  technology (or shared memory), you can also use a multipath configuration to enable two paging VIOS logical partitions to access common paging space devices. Not all virtual SCSI devices are capable of MPIO. To create an MPIO configuration, the exported device at the  must conform to the following rules: The device must be backed by a physical volume. Logical volume-backed virtual SCSI devices are not supported in an MPIO configuration. The device must be accessible from multiple  logical partitions. The device must be an MPIO-capable device.  MPIO-capable devices are those that contain a unique identifier (UDID) or IEEE volume identifier. For instructions about how to determine whether disks have a UDID or IEEE volume identifier, see . When setting up an MPIO configuration for virtual SCSI devices on the client logical partition, you must consider the reservation policy of the device on the Virtual I/O Server. To use an MPIO configuration at the client, none of the virtual SCSI devices on the Virtual I/O Server can be reserving the virtual SCSI device. Ensure the reserve_policy attribute of the device is set to no_reserve.  Failover is the only supported behavior for MPIO virtual SCSI disks on the client logical partition.

 Mirroring for client logical partitions Achieve mirroring for client logical partitions by using two virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapters. The client partition can mirror its logical volumes using two virtual SCSI client adapters. Each of these adapters should be assigned to separate  partitions.

To create a virtual target device that maps a virtual SCSI server adapter to a physical device or logical volume, complete the following steps from the  command-line interface:  name     status     description ent3     Available  Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter (l-lan) vhost0   Available  Virtual SCSI Server Adapter vhost1   Available  Virtual SCSI Server Adapter vsa0     Available  LPAR Virtual Serial Adapter vtscsi0  Available  Virtual Target Device - Logical Volume vtscsi1  Available  Virtual Target Device - File-backed Disk vtscsi2  Available  Virtual Target Device - File-backed Disk  mkvdev -vdev TargetDevice -vadapter VirtualSCSIServerAdapter Where:TargetDevice is the name of the target device, as follows:To map a logical volume to the virtual SCSI server adapter, use the name of the logical volume. For example, lv_4G. To map a physical volume to the virtual SCSI server adapter, use hdiskx. For example, hdisk5. To map an optical device to the virtual SCSI server adapter, use cdx. For example, cd0. To map a tape device to a virtual SCSI adapter, use rmtx.  For example, rmt1. VirtualSCSIServerAdapter is the name of the virtual SCSI server adapter.  If needed, use the  and  commands to determine the target device and virtual SCSI server adapter that you want to map to one another. The storage is available to the client logical partition either the next time it starts, or the next time the appropriate virtual SCSI client adapter is probed (on a  logical partition).  For example, running lsdev -virtual returns results similar to the following: name     status     description vhost3   Available  Virtual SCSI Server Adapter vsa0     Available  LPAR Virtual Serial Adapter vtscsi0  Available  Virtual Target Device - Logical Volume vttape0  Available  Virtual Target Device - Tape   For example, running lsmap -vadapter vhost3 returns results similar to the following:SVSA      Physloc                    Client PartitionID ------------------------------------------------------- vhost3    U9111.520.10DDEEC-V1-C20   0x00000000 VTD                     vtscsi0   Status                  Available LUN                     0x8100000000000000   Backing device          lv_4G Physloc The physical location is a combination of the slot number, in this case 20, and the logical partition ID. The storage is now available to the client logical partition either the next time it starts, or the next time the appropriate virtual SCSI client adapter is probed, or configured. If you later need to remove the virtual target device, you can do so by using the  command. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related information:         
 Logical volumes Understand how logical volumes can be exported to client partitions as virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) disks. A logical volume is a portion of a physical volume. A hierarchy of structures is used to manage disk storage. Each individual disk drive or LUN, called a physical volume, has a name, such as . Every physical volume in use either belongs to a volume group or is used directly for virtual storage. All of the physical volumes in a volume group are divided into physical partitions of the same size. The number of physical partitions in each region varies, depending on the total capacity of the disk drive. Within each volume group, one or more logical volumes are defined. Logical volumes are groups of information located on physical volumes. Data on logical volumes appears to the user to be contiguous but can be discontiguous on the physical volume. This allows logical volumes to be resized or relocated and to have their contents replicated. Each logical volume consists of one or more logical partitions. Each logical partition corresponds to at least one physical partition. Although the logical partitions are numbered consecutively, the underlying physical partitions are not necessarily consecutive or contiguous. After installation, the system has one volume group (the rootvg volume group) consisting of a base set of logical volumes required to start the system. You can use the commands described in the following table to manage logical volumes. Logical volume command Description Changes the characteristics of a logical volume. Copies the contents of a logical volume to a new logical volume. Increases the size of a logical volume. Displays information about the logical volume. Creates a logical volume. Creates a copy of a logical volume. Removes logical volumes from a volume group. Removes a copy of a logical volume. Creating one or more distinct volume groups rather than using logical volumes that are created in the rootvg volume group allows you to install any newer versions of the  while maintaining client data by exporting and importing the volume groups created for virtual I/O.  Logical volumes used as virtual disks must be less than 1 TB (where TB equals 1 099 511 627 776 bytes) in size. For best performance, avoid using logical volumes (on the ) as virtual disks that are mirrored or striped across multiple physical volumes. Find information about volume groups.

 Volume groups Find information about volume groups. A volume group is a type of storage pool that contains one or more physical volumes of varying sizes and types. A physical volume can belong to only one volume group per system. There can be up to 4096 active volume groups on the . When a physical volume is assigned to a volume group, the physical blocks of storage media on it are organized into physical partitions of a size determined by the system when you create the volume group. For more information, see . When you install the , the root volume group called rootvg is automatically created that contains the base set of logical volumes required to start the system logical partition.  The rootvg includes paging space, the journal log, boot data, and dump storage, each in its own separate logical volume. The rootvg has attributes that differ from user-defined volume groups. For example, the rootvg cannot be imported or exported. When using a command or procedure on the rootvg, you must be familiar with its unique characteristics. Command Description Activates a volume group Changes the attributes of a volume group Deactivates a volume group Exports the definition of a volume group Adds a physical volume to a volume group Imports a new volume group definition Displays information about a volume group Creates a volume group Removes a physical volume from a volume group Synchronizes logical volume copies that are not current Small systems might require only one volume group to contain all of the physical volumes (beyond the rootvg volume group). You can create separate volume groups to make maintenance easier because groups other than the one being serviced can remain active.  Because the rootvg must always be online, it contains only the minimum number of physical volumes necessary for system operation.  It is recommended that the rootvg not be used for client data. You can move data from one physical volume to other physical volumes in the same volume group by using the  command. This command allows you to free a physical volume so it can be removed from the volume group. For example, you could move data from a physical volume that is to be replaced. Parent topic:          
 Physical partitions This topic contains information about physical partitions. When you add a physical volume to a volume group, the physical volume is partitioned into contiguous, equal-sized units of space called physical partitions. A physical partition is the smallest unit of storage space allocation and is a contiguous space on a physical volume. Physical volumes inherit the volume group's physical partition size. Parent topic:          
 Logical partitions This topic contains information logical storage partitions. When you create a logical volume, you specify its size in megabytes or gigabytes. The system allocates the number of logical partitions that are required to create a logical volume of at least the specified size. A logical partition is one or two physical partitions, depending on whether the logical volume is defined with mirroring enabled. If mirroring is disabled, there is only one copy of the logical volume (the default). In this case, there is a direct mapping of one logical partition to one physical partition. Each instance, including the first, is called a copy.  Parent topic:          
 Quorums Find information about quorums. A quorum exists when a majority of Volume Group Descriptor Areas and Volume Group Status Areas (VGDA/VGSA) and their disks are active. A quorum ensures data integrity of the VGDA/VGSA in the event of a disk failure. Each physical disk in a volume group has at least one VGDA/VGSA. When a volume group is created onto a single disk, the volume group initially has two VGDA/VGSA on the disk. If a volume group consists of two disks, one disk still has two VGDA/VGSA, but the other disk has one VGDA/VGSA. When the volume group is made up of three or more disks, each disk is allocated just one VGDA/VGSA. A quorum is lost when enough disks and their VGDA/VGSA are unreachable so that a 51% majority of VGDA/VGSA no longer exists. When a quorum is lost, the volume group deactivates itself so that the disks are no longer accessible by the logical volume manager. This prevents further disk I/O to that volume group so that data is not lost or assumed to be written when physical problems occur. As a result of the deactivation, the user is notified in the error log that a hardware error has occurred and service must be performed.   A volume group that has been deactivated because its quorum has been lost can be reactivated by using the  command.  Parent topic:

 Replacing a repository disk On the  () Version 2.2.2.0, you can replace a repository disk by using the  command-line interface. You can replace the repository disk that is used to store cluster configuration information thereby increasing cluster resiliency. The replace operation works on a functional or failed repository disk. When the repository disk fails, the cluster remains operational. While the repository disk is in a failed state, all requests for cluster configuration fail. After you replace the failed disk, the cluster will be fully functional. As part of the replace operation, the cluster configuration information is stored on the new repository disk. The following are the requirements that must be met:The new repository disk must be at least the same size as the original disk. The  logical partitions in the cluster must be at Version 2.2.2.0, or later.  In the following example, the hdisk1 repository disk is replaced with the hdisk5 repository disk.chrepos -n -r +hdisk5 -hdisk1   Parent topic:

 Creating logical units You can create logical units and assign the logical units to virtual server adapters by using the  () command-line interface. A logical unit provides the backing storage for the virtual volume of a client partition. By using the following procedure, you can assign a logical unit for each client partition from the shared storage pool of a . Subsequently, you can map the logical unit to the virtual server adapter associated with the virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapter of the client partition by using the  ().  When the mapping operations are complete, the logical unit path is similar to the following example: SAN Storage <=> poolA <=> luA1 <=> viosA1 vtscsi0 <=> viosA1 vhost0 <=> client1 vscsi0 <=> client hdisk0.  A single logical unit can be mapped by multiple virtual server adapters, and thus, accessed by multiple client partitions. However, this mapping typically requires either an additional software layer such as a database management system or the use of the Persistent Reserves standard to manage access to the shared logical unit. A logical unit can be mapped from multiple  partitions to a single virtual client.   To create logical units and assign the logical units to virtual server adapters, complete the following steps:  For example, entering the lsmap -all command returns results similar to the following:SVSA            Physloc                              Client Partition ID -------------------------------------------------------------------------- vhost0          U8203.E4A.10D4451-V4-C12             0x00000000 VTD             NO VIRTUAL TARGET DEVICE FOUND SVSA            Physloc                              Client Partition ID -------------------------------------------------------------------------- vhost1          U8203.E4A.10D4451-V4-C13             0x00000000 Where, Physloc identifies the  virtual server adapter related to the  property for the viosA1  logical partition illustrated in the following figure.

The luA2 logical unit is then mapped to the vscsi0 virtual server adapter associated with the client2 client partition, which the  properties and the  command indicate as vhost1. mkbdsp -clustername clusterA -sp poolA 200M -bd luA2 -vadapter vhost1 -tn vtscsi1  The luA4 logical unit is created in the poolA storage pool of the clusterA , with thick-provisioning and an initial provisional size of 200 MB. The luA4 logical unit is then mapped to the vscsi0 virtual server adapter associated with the client2 client partition, which the  properties and the  command indicate as vhost1. mkbdsp -clustername clusterA -sp poolA 200M -bd luA4 -vadapter vhost1 -tn vtscsi1 -thick  The -tn vtscsiX option is not mandatory. If this option is omitted, a default value is used. By specifying the virtual target name, you can run the  command and search for information using the target name. In addition, you can map multiple logical units to the same virtual host adapter. The virtual target name is used to distinguish the mappings.  For example, entering the lssp -clustername clusterA -sp poolA -bd command returns results similar to the following. Here, the logical unit is the backing device, or bd.LU Name   Size (MB)    ProvisionType   %Used Unused(mb) LU UDID ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- luA1      100          THIN            10%   90         258f9b298bc302d9c7ee368ff50d04e3 luA2      200          THIN            15%   170        7957267e7f0ae3fc8b9768edf061d2f8 luA3      100          THICK           5%    95         459f9b298bc302fc9c7ee368f50d04e3 luA4      200          THICK           0%    200        6657267e7d0ae3fc7b9768edf061d2d2 Entering the lsmap -all command returns results similar to the following: SVSA            Physloc                                      Client Partition ID -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- vhost0          U8203.E4A.10D4451-V4-C12                     0x00000002 VTD                   vtscsi0 Status                Available LUN                   0x8100000000000000 Backing device        lua1.b1277fffdd5f38acb365413b55e51638 Physloc                 Mirrored              N/A VTD                   vtscsi1 Status                Available LUN                   0x8200000000000000 Backing device        lua2.8f5a2c27dce01bf443383a01c7f723d0 Physloc                 Mirrored              N/A In the examples in this topic, the vscsi0 virtual client SCSI adapter on client partitions Client1 and Client2  was mapped to the logical units luA1 and luA2.

 Enabling the logical unit backed storage You can enable the logical unit backed storage by using the  () command-line interface. To display the virtual physical volumes that the logical units represent in the client environments and enable the logical unit backed storage, complete the following steps:  cfgmgr lspv lsdev -c adapter -F 'name physloc' lsdev -t vdisk  -F 'name physloc'  The  command reassembles device configuration information and picks up the new mapping for the virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapter. The  and  commands on the client, and the  command on the  can be used to verify the association of the hdiskX physical volume and the vscsiX virtual SCSI adapter to the vhostY virtual server adapter on the  partition (where, X and Y are appropriate instance numbers). After the vscsiX to hdiskX mapping is verified, the normal volume group, file system management, and I/O can proceed on the client partitions, as if the hdiskX physical volume is another direct connection SCSI device. Other than establishing the client virtual physical volume association with a  path, no further action is required on the client. Hence, you can exit the client shell. These steps are unique to the  client. The  operating system also supports adding new storage devices dynamically. Run the following commands:ls -vscsi lsscsi echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/scan lsscsi cat /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/partition_name The  command displays all virtual SCSI host adapters. The  attribute displays the connected  partition. Replace hostX with the host number to which storage has been added. The  command displays all attached SCSI disks.  When new data is written to the hdiskX physical volume, the  logical partition monitors for overruns of threshold limits. A shell connection to the logical partition must be maintained to observe threshold alerts in the  error log. Alerts can also be captured by using management tools. The threshold limit can be changed to avoid or delay the alerts. Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Removing logical units You can remove logical units from the shared storage pool by using the  () command-line interface.  Before removing the logical units from shared storage pools, you must delete the mapping of physical volumes by reconfiguring the clients that reference the logical unit path. To remove a logical unit from the shared storage pool, use the following commands, as applicable:To display logical unit information, run the  command. For example, entering the lssp -clustername clusterA -sp poolA -bd command returns results similar to the following:LU Name   Size (MB)    ProvisionType   %Used Unused(mb) LU UDID ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- luA1      100          THIN            10%   90         258f9b298bc302d9c7ee368ff50d04e3 luA2      200          THIN            15%   170        7957267e7f0ae3fc8b9768edf061d2f8 luA3      100          THICK           5%    95         459f9b298bc302fc9c7ee368f50d04e3 luA4      200          THICK           0%    200        6657267e7d0ae3fc7b9768edf061d2d2 To remove a logical unit, run the  command. For example:rmbdsp -clustername clusterA -sp poolA -bd luA2  Returning a logical unit to the shared storage pool might cause a storage threshold transition alert. If the logical unit is still mapped to a different  logical partition, the  command fails. If the logical unit is only mapped to virtual server adapters on the same  logical partition on which you run the command, the mappings and the logical unit are deleted. To see the  logical partition that actually has the logical unit mapped, run the  command.   To remove one of the multiple logical units with the same name, specify the unique identifier of the logical unit. For example, when there is a second logical unit luA1, entering the following command removes that logical unit.rmbdsp -clustername clusterA -sp poolA -luudid 258f9b298bc302d9c7ee368ff50d04e3 To remove all the logical units from the shared storage pool, run the  command with the -all option.rmbdsp -clustername clusterA -sp poolA -all The shared storage pool is not removed when all the logical units are removed. All physical volumes previously added to the pool remain in the pool and cannot be removed. Delete the cluster to delete the default pool and recover the physical volumes.  To remove all the logical units, there must be no virtual target device assigned to any logical unit. Run the  command with the -vtd option on each virtual target device assigned to the logical units to ensure that no virtual target device is assigned to any logical unit.

 Deleting a  You can delete a  by using the  () command-line interface.  You cannot restore a cluster if you delete the cluster. You cannot restore a  logical partition in a cluster if the  logical partition is removed from the cluster. Deleting a  fails if the  logical partition has any mappings to logical units in the shared storage pool or if there are any logical units within the shared storage pool. Before you perform the delete operation, remove all logical partition mappings and logical units. To delete a , including the physical volumes provisioned to its storage pool, complete the following steps:  For example, when you enter lspv -free, all the physical volumes should be displayed in the free physical volume list.

 Getting started with shared storage pools by using the  command line Learn about using the  () command-line interface to manage shared storage pools. On  Version 2.2.0.11, Fix Pack 24, Service Pack 1, or later, you can create a clustering configuration. Each  has a default storage pool. You can use the  command-line interface to manage shared storage pools.   On  Version 2.2.0.11, Fix Pack 24, Service Pack 1, a  consists of only one  partition.  Version 2.2.1.0 supports only one cluster in a  partition.  On  Version 2.2.1.3, or later, a cluster consists of up to four networked  partitions.  On  Version 2.2.2.0, or later, a cluster consists of up to 16 networked  partitions. You can create a cluster with an Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address configured on the  logical partition.  The following sections describe how you can create  To perform the shell command operations listed in the following sections on the , log in to the  by using the  user ID. Learn about configuring the system to create  () shared storage pools. You can use the command-line interface on the  () to manage a . You can use the command-line interface on the  () to manage shared storage pools. You can use the command-line interface on the  () to manage logical units in shared storage pools.  You can migrate the cluster that you created and configured on the  logical partition that has Version 2.2.0.11, Fix Pack 24, Service Pack 1 to the  logical partition that has Version 2.2.1.0. By performing this task, you can restore the previous shared storage pool mappings with a new shared storage pool and database versions. The  () Version 2.2.2.0 supports rolling updates for clusters.

 Configuring the system to create shared storage pools Learn about configuring the system to create  () shared storage pools. Before creating shared storage pools, ensure that all logical partitions are preconfigured by using the  () as described in this topic. The following are the supported number of characters for the names:Cluster: 63 Storage pool: 127 Failure group: 63 Logical unit: 127 Configuring the  logical partitionConfigure 16  logical partition with the following characteristics:There must be at least one CPU and one physical CPU of entitlement. The logical partition must be configured as  logical partition. The logical partition must consist of at least 4 GB of memory. The logical partition must consist of at least one physical Fibre Channel adapter. The rootvg device for a  logical partition cannot be included in storage pool provisioning. The associated rootvg device must be installed with  Version 2.2.2.0, or later. The  logical partition must be configured with sufficient number of virtual server Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapter connections required for the client logical partitions. The  logical partition in the cluster require access to all the SAN-based physical volumes in the shared storage pool of the .  logical partition must have a network connection either through an  or through a physical adapter. On  Version 2.2.2.0, clusters support virtual local area network (VLAN) tagging. In shared storage pools, the  must be in threaded mode. For more information, see .  You cannot use the logical units in a cluster as paging devices for  or Suspend/Resume features. Configuring client logical partitionsConfigure client logical partitions with the following characteristics: The client logical partitions must be configured as  or  client systems. They must have at least 1 GB of minimum memory. The associated rootvg device must be installed with the appropriate  or  system software. Each client logical partition must be configured with a sufficient number of virtual SCSI adapter connections to map to the virtual server SCSI adapter connections of the required  logical partitions. You can define more client logical partitions. Network addressing considerationsThe following are the network address considerations: Uninterrupted network connectivity is required for shared storage pool operations. The network interface that is used for the shared storage pool configuration must be on a highly reliable network, which is not congested. Ensure that both the forward and reverse lookup for the host name that is used by the  logical partition for clustering resolves to the same IP address. With the  Version 2.2.2.0, or later, clusters support Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addresses. Therefore,  logical partitions in a cluster can have host names that resolve to an IPv6 address. To set up clusters on an IPv6 network, IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration is suggested. You can have a  logical partition configured with either IPv6 static configuration or IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration. A  logical partition that has both IPv6 static configuration and IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration is not supported in  Version 2.2.2.0. The host name of each  logical partition that belongs to the same cluster must resolve to the same IP address family, which is either Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) or IPv6.  In a cluster configuration, you cannot change the host name of a  logical partition. To change the host name, perform the following options, as applicable:If there are two or more  logical partitions in the cluster, remove the  logical partition from the cluster and change the host name. Subsequently, you can add the  logical partition to the cluster again with the new host name. If there is only one  logical partition in the cluster, you must delete the cluster and change the host name. Subsequently, you can recreate the cluster. You must make changes to the  file of the  logical partition before creating the cluster. This file is used to specify the ordering of name resolution for networking routines and commands. Later, if you want to edit the  file, perform the following steps on each  logical partition:To stop cluster services on the  logical partition, type the following command: clstartstop -stop -n clustername -m vios_hostname Make the required changes in  file. Ensure that you do not change the IP address that resolves to the host name that is being used for the cluster. To restart cluster services on the  logical partition, type the following command:clstartstop -start -n clustername -m vios_hostname Maintain the same ordering of name resolution for all the  logical partitions that are part of the same cluster. You must not make changes to the  file when you are migrating a cluster from IPv4 to IPv6. Storage provisioningWhen a  is created, you must specify one physical volume for the repository physical volume and at least one physical volume for the storage pool physical volume. The storage pool physical volumes are used to provide storage to the actual data generated by the client partitions. The maximum client storage capacity matches the total storage capacity of all storage pool physical volumes. Use any method that is available for the SAN vendor to create each physical volume with at least 20 GB of available storage space. Map the physical volume to the logical partition Fibre Channel  for each  in the . The physical volumes must only be mapped to the  logical partition connected to the shared storage pool.    logical partition assign hdisk names to all physical volumes available through the Fibre Channel ports, such as hdisk0 and hdisk1. The  logical partition might select different hdisk numbers for the same volumes. For some tasks, the unique device ID (UDID) can be used to distinguish the volumes. Use the  command to obtain the UDID for each disk. Cluster communication modeIn VIOS 2.2.3.0 or later, by default, the shared storage pool cluster is created in a unicast address mode. In earlier VIOS versions, the cluster communication mode gets created in multicast address mode. As the older cluster versions are upgraded to VIOS Version 2.2.3.0, the communication mode changes from multicast to unicast as part of rolling upgrade operation. Parent topic:  Related tasks: Related information: Failure group Failure group refers to one or more physical disks that belong to one failure domain. When the system selects a mirrored physical partition layout, it considers the failure group as a single point of failure. For example, a failure group can represent all the disks that are the children of one particular adapter (adapterA vs adapterB), or all the disks that are present on one particular SAN (sanA vs sanB), or all the disks that are present on one particular geographic location (buildingA vs buildingB). Shared storage pool mirroring The data in the shared storage pool can be mirrored across multiple disks, and the pool can withstand a physical disk failure by using the disk mirrors. In the case of disk failures, SSP Mirroring provides a better reliability for the storage pool. Hence mirroring provides higher reliability and storage availability in the shared storage pool. The existing non-mirrored shared storage pool can be mirrored by providing a set of new disks that matches the capacity of the original failure group. All these new disks are a part of the new failure group. If one or more disks or partitions of a mirrored pool fail, you would be intimated by alerts and notifications from the management console. When you get the alerts or notifications, you must replace the disk that failed with another functional disk. When the disk starts functioning again or if the disk is replaced, the resynchronization of data starts automatically.         
 Network attributes Find instructions for managing network attributes. You can use several of the  ()  commands, including , , and , to change device or network attributes. This section defines attributes that can be modified. Ethernet attributesYou can modify the following Ethernet attributes.Attribute Description  (mtu)  Specifies maximum transmission unit (MTU). This value can be any number from 60 through 65535, but it is media dependent.  (state)  detach Removes an interface from the network interface list. If the last interface is detached, the network interface driver code is unloaded. To change the interface route of an attached interface, that interface must be detached and added again with the  Interface  state=detach command. down Marks an interface as inactive, which keeps the system from trying to transmit messages through that interface. Routes that use the interface, however, are not automatically disabled.  ( Interface  state=down) up Marks an interface as active. This parameter is used automatically when setting the first address for an interface. It can also be used to enable an interface after the  Interface  state=up command.   (netmask) Specifies how much of the address to reserve for subdividing networks into subnetworks.  The mask includes both the network part of the local address and the subnet part, which is taken from the host field of the address. The mask can be specified as a single hexadecimal number beginning with 0x, in standard Internet dotted-decimal notation.  In the 32-bit address, the mask contains bits with a value of 1 for the bit positions reserved for the network and subnet parts, and a bit with the value of 0 for the bit positions that specify the host. The mask contains the standard network portion, and the subnet segment is contiguous with the network segment.  attributesYou can modify the following  attributes.Attribute Description  (pvid) Port VLAN ID (PVID). Specifies the PVID to use for the . PVID specifies the VLAN ID that is used for the non-VLAN tagged packets. PVID must match the PVID of the adapter that is specified in the pvid_adapter attribute.  (pvid_adapter) Specifies the default virtual adapter to use for non-VLAN tagged packets. PVID of the pvid_adapter attribute must be specified as the value for the pvid attribute.  (real_adapter) Specifies the physical adapter associated with the .  (thread) Activates or deactivates threading on the . Activating this option adds approximately 16 - 20% more machine cycles per transaction for MTU 1500 streaming, and approximately 31 â 38% more machine cycles per transaction for MTU 9000. The threading option adds more machine cycles per transaction at lesser workloads due to the threads being started for each packet. At higher workload rates, such as full duplex or the request/response workloads, the threads can run longer without waiting and being redispatched.  Threaded mode should be used when virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) will be run on the same  logical partition as . Threaded mode helps ensure that virtual SCSI and the  can share the processor resource appropriately. However, threading adds more instruction path length, which uses additional processor cycles. If the  logical partition will be dedicated to running shared Ethernet devices (and associated virtual Ethernet devices) only, the adapters should be configured with threading disabled.  You can enable or disable threading using the  option of the  command. To enable threading, use the -attr thread=1 option. To disable threading, use the -attr thread=0 option. For example, the following command disables threading for  ent1: mkvdev -sea ent1 -vadapter ent5 -default ent5 -defaultid 1 -attr thread=0  (virt_adapter)  Lists the virtual Ethernet adapters associated with the . (largesend) Enables TCP largesend capability (also known as segmentation offload) from logical partitions to the physical adapter. The physical adapter must be enabled for TCP largesend for the segmentation offload from the logical partition to the  to work. Also, the logical partition must be capable of performing a largesend operation. You can enable or disable TCP largesend using the  option of the  command. To enable it, use the '-a largesend=1' option. To disable it, use the '-a largesend=0' option.  For example, the following command enables largesend for  ent1:  chdev -l ent1 -a largesend=1   By default the setting is disabled (largesend=0).   Largesend is enabled by default (largesend=1) on VIOS 2.2.3.0 and higher. For VIOS 2.2.3.0 and higher, network interface that is configured over  device supports largesend operation.  (large_receive) Enables the TCP large receive offload capability on the real adapter. When it is set and if the real adapter supports it, packets received by the real adapter is aggregated before they are passed to the upper layer, resulting in better performance.  This parameter should be enabled only if all the partitions that are connected to the shared Ethernet adapter can handle packets larger than their MTU. This is not the same for Linux partitions. If all the logical partitions that are connected to the shared Ethernet adapter are AIX systems, this parameter can be enabled.  (jumbo_frames) Allows the interface configured over the  to increase its MTU to 9000 bytes (the default is 1500). If the underlying physical adapter does not support jumbo frames and the jumbo_frames attribute is set to yes, then configuration fails. The underlying physical adapter must support jumbo frames. The  automatically enables jumbo frames on its underlying physical adapter if jumbo_frames is set to yes. You cannot change the value of jumbo_frames at run time.   (gvrp) Enables and disables GVRP on a .  (qos_mode) Allows the shared Ethernet adapter to prioritize the traffic based on the IEEE 802.1Q (VLAN) Priority Code Point. When it is disabled, VLAN traffic is not inspected for priority and all frames are treated equally. In strict mode, the high priority traffic is sent preferentially over less priority traffic. This mode provides better performance and more bandwidth to more important traffic. This can result in substantial delays for less priority traffic. In loose mode, a cap is placed on each priority level so that after a number of bytes is sent for each priority level, the following level is serviced. This method ensures that all packets are eventually sent. The high priority traffic is given less bandwidth with this mode than with strict mode. The caps in loose mode are such that more bytes are sent for the high priority traffic, so it gets more bandwidth than less priority traffic.  (nthreads) Specifies the number of threads in threaded mode, where the value of the  parameter is 1. This value applies only when the thread mode is enabled. The  attribute can be set to any value between 1 - 128 and has a default value of 7.  (queue_size) Specifies the queue size for the  threads in threaded mode where the value of the  parameter is 1. This attribute indicates the number of packets that can be accommodated in each thread queue. This value applies only when the thread mode is enabled. When you change this value, the change does not take effect until the system restarts.  (hash_algo) Specifies the hash algorithm that is used to assign connections to  threads in threaded mode, where the value of the  parameter is 1. When the  parameter is set to 0, an addition operation of the source and destination Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, IP addresses, and port numbers is done. When  the  parameter is set to 1, a  function is done instead of an addition operation. The  function is slower, but it achieves better distribution. This value applies only when the thread mode is enabled.  (VSN) (lldpsvc) Activates the VSN capability on the  when you set the attribute to yes. The VSN capability can be enabled on the  () Version 7 Release 7.7.0, or later. The default value of the  attribute is no. This attribute must be set to no before you remove the . For example, the following command enables the VSN capability for the  ent1:chdev -dev ent1 -a lldpsvc=yes  (accounting) When enabled, the shared Ethernet adapter keeps a count of the number of bytes and packets that are bridged to and from each client LPAR. Use the  command to see those statistics.  failover attributesYou can modify the following  failover attributes. Attribute Description  (ha_mode)  Determines whether the devices participate in a failover setup. The default is disabled. Typically, a  in a failover setup is operating in auto mode, and the primary adapter is decided based on which adapter has the highest priority (lowest numerical value). A shared Ethernet device can be forced into the standby mode, where it will behave as the backup device as long as it can detect the presence of a functional primary. The following are the possible values for the  attribute:Disabled This value is the default value. It indicates that the  does not participate in  failover configuration. You must use this value only if you do not want to use  failover configuration on the system. If the  is configured previously in the  failover configuration, do not use this value.  Auto This value indicates that the  is in traditional failover configuration. In this configuration, one  is the primary adapter and the other  is the backup adapter. Depending on the priority value of the trunk adapters, a  is configured as the primary or the backup adapter. Standby A shared Ethernet device can be forced into the Standby mode. A device that is in this mode functions as the backup device for the duration in which it can detect a functional primary adapter. Sharing This value indicates that the  is participating in load sharing. For the  to participate in load sharing, the load sharing criteria must be met. Also, the  attribute must be set to the Sharing mode on both Shared Ethernet Adapters.   (ctl_chan) Sets the virtual Ethernet device that is required for a  in a failover setup so that it can communicate with the other adapter. There is no default value for this attribute, and it is required when the ha_mode is not set to disabled. The Control Channel attribute is an optional attribute with the Power Hypervisor Version 780, or later and with the  Version 2.2.3.0, or later.  (netaddr) Optional attribute that can be specified for a  that has been configured in a failover setup. When this attribute is specified, a shared Ethernet device will periodically ping the IP address to verify connectivity (in addition to checking for link status of the physical devices). If it detects a loss of connectivity to the specified ping host, it will initiate a failover to the backup . This attribute is not supported when you use a  with a  (or Integrated Virtual Ethernet).  (adapter_reset) When enabled, the shared Ethernet adapter disables and re-enables its physical adapter whenever it becomes inactive. It might help the external switch to direct the traffic to the new server. By default the setting is enabled.   (send_RARP) When enabled, the shared Ethernet adapter sends a reverse ARP after the  failover. The reverse ARP is sent by a new primary  to notify the switches of routing change. By default, the setting is enabled.  INET attributesYou can modify the following INET attributes. Attribute Description  (hostname) Specify the host name that you want to assign to the current machine. When specifying the host name, use ASCII characters, preferably alphanumeric only. Do not use a period in the host name. Avoid using hexadecimal or decimal values as the first character (for example 3Comm, where 3C might be interpreted as a hexadecimal character).  For compatibility with earlier hosts, use an unqualified host name of fewer than 32 characters.  If the host uses a domain name server for name resolution, the host name must contain the full domain name.  In the hierarchical domain naming system, names consist of a sequence of subnames that are not case-sensitive and that are separated by periods with no embedded blanks. The DOMAIN protocol specifies that a local domain name must be fewer than 64 characters, and that a host name must be fewer than 32 characters in length. The host name is given first. Optionally, the full domain name can be specified; the host name is followed by a period, a series of local domain names separated by periods, and finally by the root domain. A fully specified domain name for a host, including periods, must be fewer than 255 characters in length and in   the following form: host.subdomain.subdomain.rootdomain  In a hierarchical network, certain hosts are designated as name servers that resolve names into Internet addresses for other hosts.  This arrangement has two advantages over the flat name space: resources of each host on the network are not consumed in resolving names, and the person who manages the system does not need to maintain name-resolution files on each machine on the network. The set of names managed by a single name server is known as its zone of authority.  (gateway) Identifies the gateway to which packets are addressed. The Gateway parameter can be specified either by symbolic name or numeric address.  (route) Specifies the route. The format of the Route attribute is: route=destination, gateway, [metric]. destination Identifies the host or network to which you are directing the route. The Destination parameter can be specified either by symbolic name or numeric address. gateway Identifies the gateway to which packets are addressed. The Gateway parameter can be specified either by symbolic name or numeric address. metric Sets the routing metric. The default is 0 (zero). The routing metric is used by the routing protocol (the routed daemon). Higher metrics have the effect of making a route less favorable. Metrics are counted as additional hops to the destination network or host.  Adapter attributesYou can modify the following adapter attributes. The attribute behavior can vary, based on the adapter and driver you have. Attribute Adapters/Drivers Description  (media_speed)  2-Port 10/100/1000 Base-TX PCI-X Adapter 10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet PCI-X Adapter Device Driver  The media speed attribute indicates the speed at which the adapter attempts to operate. The available speeds are 10 Mbps half-duplex, 10 Mbps full-duplex, 100 Mbps half-duplex, 100 Mbps full-duplex and autonegotiation, with a default of autonegotiation. Select auto-negotiate when the adapter should use autonegotiation across the network to determine the speed. When the network will not support autonegotiation, select the specific speed. 1000 MBps half and full duplex are not valid values. According to the IEEE 802.3z specification, gigabit speeds of any duplexity must be autonegotiated for copper (TX)-based adapters. If these speeds are desired, select auto-negotiate.  (media_speed)   2-Port Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Device Driver The media speed attribute indicates the speed at which the adapter attempts to operate. The available speeds are 1000 Mbps full-duplex and autonegotiation. The default is autonegotiation. Select auto-negotiate when the adapter should use autonegotiation across the network to determine the duplexity. When the network does not support autonegotiation, select 1000 Mbps full-duplex.  (media_speed)   10/100 Mbps Ethernet PCI Adapter Device Driver The media speed attribute indicates the speed at which the adapter attempts to operate. The available speeds are 10 Mbps half-duplex, 10 Mbps full-duplex, 100 Mbps half-duplex, 100 Mbps full-duplex and autonegotiation, with a default of autonegotiation. When the adapter should use autonegotiation across the network to determine the speed, select autonegotiate. When the network will not support autonegotiation, select the specific speed. If autonegotiation is selected, the remote link device must also be set to autonegotiate to ensure the link works correctly.  (media_speed)   10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet PCI adapter Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI Adapter Device Driver The media speed attribute indicates the speed at which the adapter attempts to operate. The available speeds are 10 Mbps half-duplex, 10 Mbps full-duplex, 100 Mbps half-duplex, 100 Mbps full-duplex and autonegotiation, with a default of autonegotiation. Select autonegotiate when the adapter should use autonegotiation across the network to determine the speed. When the network will not support autonegotiation, select the specific speed. For the adapter to run at 1000 Mbit/s, the autonegotiation setting must be selected.   For the Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI Adapter, the only selection available is autonegotiation.  (use_alt_addr) Â  Setting this attribute to yes indicates that the address of the adapter, as it appears on the network, is the one specified by the Alternate Ethernet Address attribute. If you specify the no value, the unique adapter address written in a ROM on the adapter card is used. The default value is no.                          (alt_addr) Â  Allows the adapter unique address, as it appears on the LAN network, to be changed. The value entered must be an Ethernet address of 12 hexadecimal digits and must not be the same as the address of any other Ethernet adapter. There is no default value. This field has no effect unless the Enable Alternate Ethernet Address attribute is set to yes value, in which case this field must be filled in. A typical Ethernet address is 0x02608C000001. All 12 hexadecimal digits, including leading zeros, must be entered.                     (poll_link)  10/100Mbps Ethernet PCI Adapter Device Driver Select no to cause the device driver to poll the adapter to determine the status of the link at a specified time interval. The time interval value is specified in the  field. If you select no, the device driver will not poll the adapter for its link status. The default value is no.     (poll_link_time)  10/100Mbps Ethernet PCI Adapter Device Driver The amount of time, in milliseconds, between polls to the adapter for its link status that the device driver is allowed. This value is required when the  option is set to yes.  A value between 100 through 1000 can be specified. The incremental value is 10. The default value is 500.    (flow_ctrl)  10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet PCI-X Adapter Device Driver Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Device Driver 2-Port 10/100/1000 Base-TX PCI-X Adapter 2-Port Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI Adapter Device Driver This attribute specifies whether the adapter should enable transmit and receive flow control. The default value is no.  (jumbo_frames)  10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet PCI-X Adapter Device Driver Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Device Driver 2-Port 10/100/1000 Base-TX PCI-X Adapter 2-Port Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI Adapter Device Driver Setting this attribute to yes indicates that frames up to 9018 bytes in length might be transmitted on this adapter. If you specify no, the maximum size of frames transmitted is 1518 bytes. Frames up to 9018 bytes in length can always be received on this adapter.   (chksum_offload)  10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet PCI-X Adapter Device Driver Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Device Driver 2-Port 10/100/1000 Base-TX PCI-X Adapter 2-Port Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI Adapter Device Driver Virtual Ethernet adapters Setting this attribute to yes indicates that the adapter calculates the checksum for transmitted and received TCP frames. If you specify no, the checksum will be calculated by the appropriate software.When a virtual Ethernet adapter has checksum offload enabled, the adapter advertises it to the hypervisor. The hypervisor tracks which virtual Ethernet adapters have checksum offload enabled and manages inter-partition communication accordingly. When network packets are routed through the , there is a potential for link errors. In this environment, the packets must traverse the physical link with a checksum. Communication works in the following way:When a packet is received from the physical link, the physical adapter verifies the checksum. If the packet's destination is a virtual Ethernet adapter with checksum offload enabled, the receiver does not have to perform checksum verification. A receiver that does not have checksum offload enabled will accept the packet after checksum verification. When a packet originates from a virtual Ethernet adapter with checksum offload enabled, it travels to the physical adapter without a checksum. The physical adapter will generate a checksum before sending the packet out. Packets originating from a virtual Ethernet adapter with checksum offload disabled generate the checksum at the source.    To enable checksum offload for a , all constituent devices must have it enabled as well. The shared Ethernet device will fail if the underlying devices do not have the same checksum offload settings.  (large_send)   10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet PCI-X Adapter Device Driver Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Device Driver 2-Port 10/100/1000 Base-TX PCI-X Adapter 2-Port Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI-X Adapter Gigabit Ethernet-SX PCI Adapter Device Driver This attribute specifies whether the adapter is to perform transmit TCP resegmentation for TCP segments. The default value is no.  device attributesYou can modify the following  attributes.Attribute Description  (adapter_names) The adapters that currently make up the  device. If you want to modify these adapters, modify this attribute and select all the adapters that should belong to the  device. When you use this attribute to select all of the adapters that should belong to the  device, its interface must not have an IP address configured.    (mode) The type of channel that is configured. In standard mode, the channel sends the packets to the adapter based on an algorithm (the value used for this calculation is determined by the Hash Mode attribute). In round_robin mode, the channel gives one packet to each adapter before repeating the loop. The default mode is standard. Using the 802.3ad mode, the  Control Protocol (LACP) negotiates the adapters in the  device with an LACP-enabled switch.  If the Hash Mode attribute is set to anything other than the default, this attribute must be set to standard or 802.3ad. Otherwise, the configuration of the  device will fail.  (hash_mode) If operating under standard or IEEE 802.3ad mode, the hash mode attribute determines how the outgoing adapter for each packet is chosen. Following are the different modes: default: uses the destination IP address to determine the outgoing adapter. src_port: uses the source TCP or UDP port for that connection. dst_port: uses the destination TCP or UDP port for that connection. src_dst_port: uses both the source and destination TCP or UDP ports for that connection to determine the outgoing adapter. You cannot use round-robin mode with any hash mode value other than default. The  device configuration will fail if you attempt this combination. If the packet is not TCP or UDP, it uses the default hashing mode (destination IP address). Using TCP or UDP ports for hashing can make better use of the adapters in the  device, because connections to the same destination IP address can be sent over different adapters (while still retaining the order of the packets), thus increasing the bandwidth of the  device.  (netaddr) This field is optional. The IP address that the  device should ping to verify that the network is up. This is only valid when there is a backup adapter and when there are one or more adapters in the  device. An address of zero (or all zeros) is ignored and disables the sending of ping packets if a valid address was previously defined. The default is to leave this field blank.  (retry_time) This field is optional. It controls how often the  device sends out a ping packet to poll the current adapter for link status. This is valid only when the  device has one or more adapters, a backup adapter is defined, and the  field contains a non-zero address. Specify the timeout value in seconds.  The range of valid values is 1 to 100 seconds. The default value is 1 second.  (num_retries) This field is optional. It specifies the number of lost ping packets before the  device switches adapters. This is valid only when the  device has one or more adapters, a backup adapter is defined, and the  field contains a non-zero address. The range of valid values is 2 to 100 retries. The default value is 3.  (use_jumbo_frame) This field is optional. To use this attribute, all of the underlying adapters, as well as the switch, must support jumbo frames. This will work only with a Standard Ethernet (en) interface, not an IEEE 802.3 (et) interface.   (use_alt_addr) This field is optional. If you set this to yes, you can specify a MAC address that you want the  device to use. If you set this option to no, the  device uses the MAC address of the first adapter.   (alt_addr)  If  is set to yes, specify the MAC address that you want to use. The address you specify must start with 0x and be a 12-digit hexadecimal address.  VLAN attributesYou can modify the following VLAN attributes. Attribute Value  (vlan_tag_id) The unique ID associated with the VLAN driver. You can specify from 1 to 4094.  (base_adapter) The network adapter to which the VLAN device driver is connected.  QoS attributeYou can modify the following qos_mode attribute. disabled mode  This is the default mode. VLAN traffic is not inspected for the priority field. For example,chdev -dev <sea device name> -attr qos_mode=disabled strict mode  More important traffic is bridged over less important traffic. This mode provides better performance and more bandwidth to more important traffic; however, it can result in substantial delays for less important traffic. For example,chdev -dev <sea device name> -attr qos_mode=strict loose mode  A cap is placed on each priority level, so that after a number of bytes are sent for each priority level, the next level is serviced. This method ensures that all packets will eventually be sent. More important traffic is given less bandwidth with this mode than with strict mode; however, the caps in loose mode are such that more bytes are sent for the more important traffic, so it still gets more bandwidth than less important traffic. For example,chdev -dev <sea device name> -attr qos_mode=loose Client-specific  statisticsTo gather network statistics at a client level, enable advanced accounting on the  to provide more information about its network traffic. To enable client statistics, set the  accounting attribute to enabled (the default value is disabled). When advanced accounting is enabled, the  keeps track of the hardware (MAC) addresses of all of the packets it receives from the LPAR clients, and increments packet and byte counts for each client independently. After advanced accounting is enabled on the , you can generate a report to view per-client statistics by running the  command. The command must be run on the , which is actively bridging the traffic. Advanced accounting must be enabled on the  before you can use the  command to print any statistics. To enable advanced accounting on the , enter the following command: chdev -dev <sea device name> -attr accounting=enabled The following command displays per-client  statistics. The optional -n flag disables name resolution on IP addresses. seastat -d <sea device name> [-n]  The following command clears all of the per-client  statistics that have been gathered: seastat -d <sea device name> -c Parent topic:

  failover statistics Learn about  failover statistics, such as high availability information and packet types, and view examples. Statistic descriptionsStatistic Description High availability Control Channel PVID Port VLAN ID of the virtual Ethernet adapter used as the control channel. Control Packets in Number of packets received on the control channel. Control Packets out Number of packets sent on the control channel. Packet types Keep-Alive Packets Number of keep-alive packets received on the control channel. Keep-alive packets are received on the backup  while the primary  is active. Recovery Packets Number of recovery packets received on the control channel. Recovery packets are sent by the primary  when it recovers from a failure and is ready to be active again. Notify Packets Number of notify packets received on the control channel. Notify packets are sent by the backup  when it detects that the primary  has recovered. Limbo Packets Number of limbo packets received on the control channel. Limbo packets are sent by the primary  when it detects that its physical network is not operational, or when it cannot ping the specified remote host (to inform the backup that it needs to become active). State The current state of the .INIT The  failover protocol has just been initiated. PRIMARY The  is actively connecting traffic between the VLANs to the network. BACKUP The  is idle and not connecting traffic between the VLANs and the network. RECOVERY The primary  recovered from a failure and is ready to be active again. NOTIFY The backup  detected that the primary  recovered from a failure and that it needs to become idle again. LIMBO One of the following situations is true:The physical network is not operational. The physical network's state is unknown. The  cannot ping the specified remote host. Bridge Mode Describes to what level, if any, the  is currently bridging traffic.Unicast The  is only sending and receiving unicast traffic (no multicast or broadcast traffic). To avoid broadcast storms, the  sends and receives unicast traffic only while it is in the INIT or the RECOVERY states. All The  is sending and receiving all types of network traffic. None The  is not sending or receiving any network traffic. Number of Times Server became Backup Number of times the  was active and became idle because of a failure. Number of Times Server became Primary Number of times the  was idle and became active because the primary  failed. High Availability Mode How the  behaves regarding the  failover protocol.Auto The  failover protocol determines whether the  acts as the primary  or as the backup . Standby The  operates as a backup if there is another  available to act as the primary. Standby causes a primary  to become a backup  if there is another  that can become the primary . Priority Specifies the trunk priority of the virtual Ethernet adapters of the . It is used by the  protocol to determine which  acts as the primary  and which  acts as the backup .

  statistics Learn about general  statistics, such as VLAN IDs and packet information, and view examples. Statistic descriptionsStatistic Description Number of adapters Includes the real adapter and all of the virtual adapters.  If you are using  failover, then the control channel adapter is not included.  flags Denotes the features that the  is currently running.THREAD The  is operating in threaded mode, where incoming packets are queued and processed by different threads; its absence denotes interrupt mode, where packets are processed in the same interrupt where they are received. LARGESEND The large send feature has been enabled on the . JUMBO_FRAMES The jumbo frames feature has been enabled on the . GVRP The GVRP feature has been enabled on the . VLAN IDs List of VLAN IDs that have access to the network through the  (this includes PVID and all tagged VLANs). Real adapters Packets received Number of packets received on the physical network. Packets bridged Number of packets received on the physical network that were sent to the virtual network. Packets consumed Number of packets received on the physical network that were addressed to the interface configured over the . Packets fragmented Number of packets received on the physical network that were fragmented before being sent to the virtual network. They were fragmented because they were bigger than the outgoing adapter's Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). Packets transmitted Number of packets sent on the physical network. This includes packets sent from the interface configured over the , as well as each packet sent from the virtual network to the physical network (including fragments). Packets dropped Number of packets received on the physical network that were dropped for one of the following reasons:The packet was the oldest packet on a thread's queue and there was no space to accommodate a newly received packet. The packet had an invalid VLAN ID and could not be processed. The packet was addressed to the  interface, but its interface had no filters registered. Packets filtered (VLAN ID) Number of packets that are received on the physical network and that were not sent to the virtual network because of an unknown VLAN ID.  Packets filtered (Reserved address) Number of packets that are received on the physical network that were not bridged to any of the trunk virtual Ethernet adapters because the destination MAC address is a reserved multicast address that is only useful for bridges. Virtual adapters Packets received Number of packets received on the virtual network. In other words, the number of packets received on all of the virtual adapters. Packets bridged Number of packets received on the virtual network that were sent to the physical network. Packets consumed Number of packets received on the virtual network that were addressed to the interface configured over the . Packets fragmented Number of packets received on the virtual network that were fragmented before being sent to the physical network. They were fragmented because they were bigger than the outgoing adapter's MTU. Packets transmitted Number of packets sent on the virtual network. This includes packets sent from the interface configured over the , as well as each packet sent from the physical network to the virtual network (including fragments). Packets dropped Number of packets received on the virtual network that were dropped for one of the following reasons:The packet was the oldest packet on a thread's queue and there was no space to accommodate a newly received packet. The packet was addressed to the  interface, but its interface had no filters registered. Packets filtered (VLAN ID) In a shared high availability mode, the number of packets that are received on the virtual network and that were not sent to the physical network because they did not belong to the VLAN that is bridged by the shared Ethernet adapter. Output packets generated Number of packets with a valid VLAN tag or no VLAN tag sent out of the interface configured over the . Output packets dropped Number of packets sent out of the interface configured over the  that are dropped because of an invalid VLAN tag. Device output failures Number of packets that could not be sent due to underlying device errors. This includes errors sent on the physical network and virtual network, including fragments and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error packets generated by the . Memory allocation failures Number of packets that could not be sent because there was insufficient network memory to complete an operation. ICMP error packets sent Number of ICMP error packets successfully sent when a big packet could not be fragmented because the don't fragment bit was set. Non IP packets larger than MTU Number of packets that could not be sent because they were bigger than the outgoing adapter's MTU and could not be fragmented because they were not IP packets. Thread queue overflow packets Number of packets that were dropped from the thread queues because there was no space to accommodate a newly received packet.             The  counts the sum of transmitted                 statistics for all . The  counts the sum of received statistics for all                     . For example, consider the following                 setup, where a  has a real                 and a virtual adapter:ent5 = SEA ent0 = Real adapter ent1 = Virtual adapter             If a VIOClient receives 100 MB from a server, the  real adapter records 100 MB on its , and the                  virtual adapter records 100 MB on its . In this                 setup, the  record 100 MB for Transmit                 and 100 MB for Receive statistics.             If a VIOClient sends 300 MB to a server, the  real adapter records 300 MB on its , and the                  virtual adapter records 300 MB on its . In this                 setup, the  record 300 MB for Transmit                 and 300 MB for Receive statistics. In a threaded mode, a section follows with the statistics for each queue of each thread that handled packets. There is one queue per thread if QoS is disabled and 7 queues per thread if QoS is enabled. Up to 8 queues per thread are displayed if QoS mode is changed. You can use these statistics to verify whether the packets are distributed evenly between queues, whether the queues are sized correctly, and whether there are sufficient number of threads. Statistic Description Queue full dropped packets Number of packets that were dropped from this thread queue because there was no space to accommodate a newly received packet. Queue packets queued Number of packets that are currently queued in this thread queue. Queue average packets queued Average number of packets present in this thread queue after a newly received packet is queued. A value of N indicates that on an average, there were N-1 packets already present in the queue when a new packet was queued. Queue packets count Total number of packets that have passed through this thread queue. Queue max packets queued Maximum number of packets that was handled by this thread queue.

The  comprises the following primary components: Virtual SCSI Virtual networking  () The following sections provide a brief overview of each of these components. Virtual SCSIPhysical adapters with attached disks or optical devices on the  logical partition can be shared by one or more client logical partitions. The  offers a local storage subsystem that provides standard SCSI-compliant logical unit numbers (LUNs). The  can export a pool of heterogeneous physical storage as a homogeneous pool of block storage in the form of SCSI disks.  Unlike typical storage subsystems that are physically located in the storage area network (SAN), the SCSI devices exported by the  are limited to the domain within the server. Although the SCSI LUNs are SCSI compliant, they might not meet the needs of all applications, particularly those that exist in a distributed environment. The following SCSI peripheral-device types are supported:Disks backed up by logical volumes Disks backed up by physical volumes Disks backed up by files Optical devices (DVD-RAM and DVD-ROM) Optical devices backed up by files Tape devices  		 Virtual networking provides the following virtual networking technologies. Virtual networking technology Description A  is a layer-2 Ethernet bridge that connects physical and virtual networks together. It allows logical partitions on the virtual local area network (VLAN) to share access to a physical Ethernet adapter and to communicate with systems outside the server. On  processor-based systems, you can assign a logical host Ethernet port of a logical Host Ethernet Adapter, sometimes referred to as Integrated Virtual Ethernet, as the real adapter of a . A  is a physical Ethernet adapter that is integrated directly into the GX+ bus on a managed system. s offer high throughput, low latency, and virtualization support for Ethernet connections. The  on the  supports IPv6. IPv6 is the next generation of Internet Protocol and is gradually replacing the current Internet standard, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). The key IPv6 enhancement is the expansion of the IP address space from 32 bits to 128 bits, providing virtually unlimited, unique IP addresses.  failover  failover provides redundancy by configuring a backup  on a different  logical partition that can be used if the primary  fails. The network connectivity in the client logical partitions continues without disruption. A   device is a network port-aggregation technology that allows several Ethernet adapters to be aggregated. helps provide more throughput over a single IP address than would be possible with a single Ethernet adapter. VLAN VLAN allows the physical network to be logically segmented. The  provides a browser-based interface and a command-line interface that you can use to manage some servers that use the .

 Virtual Fibre Channel With N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV), you can configure the managed system so that multiple logical partitions can access independent physical storage through the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. To access physical storage in a typical storage area network (SAN) that uses Fibre Channel, the physical storage is mapped to logical units (LUNs) and the LUNs are mapped to the ports of physical Fibre Channel adapters. Each physical port on each physical Fibre Channel adapter is identified using one worldwide port name (WWPN). NPIV is a standard technology for Fibre Channel networks that enables you to connect multiple logical partitions to one physical port of a physical Fibre Channel adapter. Each logical partition is identified by a unique WWPN, which means that you can connect each logical partition to independent physical storage on a SAN. To enable NPIV on the managed system, you must create a  logical partition (version 2.1, or later) that provides virtual resources to client logical partitions. You assign the physical Fibre Channel adapters (that support NPIV) to the  logical partition. Then, you connect virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the client logical partitions to virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  logical partition. A virtual Fibre Channel adapter is a virtual adapter that provides client logical partitions with a Fibre Channel connection to a storage area network through the  logical partition. The  logical partition provides the connection between the virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  logical partition and the physical Fibre Channel adapters on the managed system. The following figure shows a managed system configured to use NPIV. The figure shows the following connections: A storage area network (SAN) connects three units of physical storage to a physical Fibre Channel adapter that is located on the managed system. The physical Fibre Channel adapter is assigned to the  and supports NPIV. The physical Fibre Channel adapter connects to three virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the . All three virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  connect to the same physical port on the physical Fibre Channel adapter.  Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the  connects to one virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition. Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter on each client logical partition receives a pair of unique WWPNs. The client logical partition uses one WWPN to log into the SAN at any given time. The other WWPN is used when you move the client logical partition to another managed system.  Using their unique WWPNs and the virtual Fibre Channel connections to the physical Fibre Channel adapter, the operating systems that run in the client logical partitions discover, instantiate, and manage their physical storage located on the SAN. In the previous figure, Client logical partition 1 accesses Physical storage 1, Client logical partition 2 accesses Physical storage 2, and Client logical partition 3 accesses Physical storage 3.  The  cannot access and does not emulate the physical storage to which the client logical partitions have access. The  provides the client logical partitions with a connection to the physical Fibre Channel adapters on the managed system.  There is always a one-to-one relationship between virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the client logical partitions and the virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  logical partition. That is, each virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition must connect to only one virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the  logical partition, and each virtual Fibre Channel on the  logical partition must connect to only one virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition.  Using SAN tools, you can zone and mask LUNs that include WWPNs that are assigned to virtual Fibre Channel adapters on client logical partitions. The SAN uses WWPNs that are assigned to virtual Fibre Channel adapters on client logical partitions the same way it uses WWPNs that are assigned to physical ports. You can configure virtual Fibre Channel adapters on client logical partitions that run the following operating systems:  Version 6.1 Technology Level 2, or later  Version 5.3 Technology Level 9  Version 6.1.1, or later  Version 11, or later  Version 10, Service Pack 3, or later  Enterprise Server Version 5.4 or later  Enterprise Server Version 6 or later  Version 11, or later  Version 10, Service Pack 3, or later  Enterprise Server Version 5.4 or later  Enterprise Server Version 6 or later On systems that are managed by the  (), you can dynamically add and remove virtual Fibre Channel adapters to and from the  logical partition and each client logical partition.

To enable N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) on the managed system, you create the required virtual Fibre Channel adapters and connections as follows: You use the  to create virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  logical partition and associate them with virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the client logical partitions. You use the  to create virtual Fibre Channel adapters on each client logical partition and associate them with virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  logical partition. When you create a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition, the  generates a pair of unique WWPNs for the client virtual Fibre Channel adapter.  You connect the virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  to the physical ports of the physical Fibre Channel adapter by running the  command on the . The  generates WWPNs based on the range of names available for use with the prefix in the vital product data on the managed system. This 6âdigit prefix comes with the purchase of the managed system and includes 32 000 pairs of WWPNs. When you remove a virtual Fibre Channel adapter from a client logical partition, the hypervisor deletes the WWPNs that are assigned to the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the client logical partition. The  does not reuse the deleted WWPNs when generating WWPNs for virtual Fibre Channel adapters in the future. If you run out of WWPNs, you must obtain an activation code that includes another prefix with another 32 000 pairs of WWPNs. To avoid configuring the physical Fibre Channel adapter to be a single point of failure for the connection between the client logical partition and its physical storage on the SAN, do not connect two virtual Fibre Channel adapters from the same client logical partition to the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. Instead, connect each virtual Fibre Channel adapter to a different physical Fibre Channel adapter.  You can dynamically add and remove virtual Fibre Channel adapters to and from the  logical partition and to and from client logical partitions. Dynamically add or remove virtual Fibre Channel adapter To or from a client logical partition or a  logical partition Result Add a virtual Fibre Channel adapter To a client logical partition The  generates the a pair of unique WWPNs for the client virtual Fibre Channel adapter. Add a virtual Fibre Channel adapter To a  logical partition You need to connect the virtual Fibre Channel adapter to a physical port on a physical Fibre Channel adapter. Remove a virtual Fibre Channel adapter From a client logical partition The hypervisor deletes the WWPNs and does not reuse them. You must either remove the associated virtual Fibre Channel adapter from the , or associate it with another virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition. Remove a virtual Fibre Channel adapter From a  logical partition The  removes the connection to the physical port on the physical Fibre Channel adapter.

 Virtual Fibre Channel on IVM-managed systems On systems that are managed by the  (IVM), you can dynamically add and remove worldwide port names (WWPNs) to and from logical partitions, and you can dynamically change the physical ports to which the WWPNs are assigned. You can also view information about the virtual and physical fibre channel adapters and the WWPNs by using the  and  commands. To enable N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) on the managed system, you create a pair of WWPNs for a logical partition and assign the pair directly to the physical ports of the physical Fibre Channel adapters. You can assign multiple logical partitions to one physical port by assigning a pair of WWPNs for each logical partition to the same physical port. When you assign a WWPN pair to a logical partition, the IVM automatically creates the following connections: The IVM creates a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition and associates it with the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the logical partition.  The IVM generates a pair of unique WWPNs and creates a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the client logical partition. The IVM assigns the WWPNs to the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the client logical partition, and associates the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the client logical partition with the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition. When you assign the WWPNs for a logical partition to a physical port, the IVM connects the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition to the physical port on the physical Fibre Channel adapter. The IVM generates WWPNs based on the range of names available for use with the prefix in the vital product data on the managed system. This 6âdigit prefix comes with the purchase of the managed system and includes 32 768 pairs of WWPNs. When you remove the connection between a logical partition and a physical port, the hypervisor deletes the WWPNs that are assigned to the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the logical partition. The IVM does not reuse the deleted WWPNs when generating WWPNs for virtual Fibre Channel adapters in the future. If you run out of WWPNs, you must obtain an activation code that includes another prefix with 32 768 pairs of WWPNs. To avoid configuring the physical Fibre Channel adapter to be a single point of failure for the connection between the logical partition and its physical storage on the storage area network (SAN), do not assign a logical partition to one physical Fibre Channel adapter twice. For example, do not assign a WWPN pair for a logical partition to a physical port on a physical Fibre Channel adapter, and then assign another WWPN pair for the same logical partition to another physical port on the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. Instead, assign the WWPN pairs for each logical partition to different physical Fibre Channel adapters.  You can add WWPN pairs for a new logical partition without assigning them to a physical port. Being able to generate WWPNs independently of a physical port assignment for a logical partition allows you to communicate these names to the SAN administrator. This ensures that the SAN administrator can configure the SAN connection appropriately such that the logical partition can connect successfully to the SAN without regard for which physical port the partition uses for the connection. You can dynamically add or remove a WWPN pair to and from a logical partition. You can also dynamically change the physical port that is assigned to a WWPN pair. Action Result Dynamically add a WWPN pair to a logical partition The IVM creates a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition and associates it with the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the logical partition.  The IVM generates a pair of unique WWPNs and creates a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the logical partition. The IVM assigns the WWPNs to the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the logical partition, and associates the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the logical partition with the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition. Dynamically assign a WWPN pair to a physical port The IVM connects the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition to the physical port on the physical Fibre Channel adapter. Dynamically remove a WWPN pair from a logical partition The IVM removes the connection between the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition and the physical port on the physical Fibre Channel adapter. The IVM removes the virtual Fibre Channel adapter from the management partition. The IVM removes the virtual Fibre Channel adapter from the logical partition. The IVM deletes the WWPNs and does not reuse them. Dynamically change the physical port assignment of a WWPN pair The  changes the connection for the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition to the newly assigned physical port. When you change the physical port to a value of None, the  retains the virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition, but removes the connection to the physical port on the physical Fibre Channel adapter. If you later reassign a physical port to the WWPN pair, the  reuses the original virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the management partition and connects the adapter to the newly assigned physical port. The following table lists the  commands that you can run to view information about the Fibre Channel adapters.Virtual I/O Server command Information displayed by command Displays the virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  that are connected to the physical Fibre Channel adapter Displays attributes of the virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the client logical partitions that are associated with the virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  that are connected to the physical Fibre Channel adapter Displays information about the physical ports on the physical Fibre Channel adapters that support NPIV, such as:The name and location code of the physical port The number of available physical ports  The total number of WWPNs that the physical port can support Whether the switches, to which the physical Fibre Channel adapters are cabled, support NPIV Parent topic:          
 Redundancy configuration using virtual Fibre Channel adapters Redundancy configurations help protect your network from physical adapter failures as well as Virtual I/O Server failures.  With N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV), you can configure the managed system so that multiple logical partitions can access independent physical storage through the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter is identified by a unique worldwide port name (WWPN), which means that you can connect each virtual Fibre Channel adapter to independent physical storage on a SAN.  Similar to virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) redundancy, virtual Fibre Channel redundancy can be achieved using Multi-path I/O (MPIO) and mirroring at the client partition. The difference between traditional redundancy with SCSI adapters and the NPIV technology using virtual Fibre Channel adapters, is that the redundancy occurs on the client, because only the client recognizes the disk.  The  is essentially just a pipe. Example 2 uses multiple  logical partitions to add redundancy at the  level as well.  Example 1: Host bus adapter failoverThis example uses Host bus adapter (HBA) failover to provide a basic level of redundancy for the client logical partition. The figure shows the following connections: The storage area network (SAN) connects physical storage to two physical Fibre Channel adapters located on the managed system.  The physical Fibre Channel adapters are assigned to the  and support NPIV. The physical Fibre Channel ports are each connected to a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the . The two virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  are connected to ports on two different physical Fibre Channel adapters in order to provide redundancy for the physical adapters.  Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the  is connected to one virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition. Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter on each client logical partition receives a pair of unique WWPNs. The client logical partition uses one WWPN to log into the SAN at any given time. The other WWPN is used when you move the client logical partition to another managed system. The virtual Fibre Channel adapters always has a one-to-one relationship between the client logical partitions and the virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  logical partition. That is, each virtual Fibre Channel adapter that is assigned to a client logical partition must connect to only one virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the , and each virtual Fibre Channel on the  must connect to only one virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition.  The client can write to the physical storage through client virtual Fibre Channel adapter 1 or 2. If a physical Fibre Channel adapter fails, the client uses the alternative path. This example does not show redundancy in the physical storage, but rather assumes it would be built into the SAN.  It is recommended that you configure virtual Fibre Channel adapters from multiple logical partitions to the same HBA, or you configure virtual Fibre Channel adapters from the same logical partition to different HBAs. Example 2: HBA and  failoverThis example uses HBA and  failover to provide a more advanced level of redundancy for the client logical partition. The figure shows the following connections: The storage area network (SAN) connects physical storage to two physical Fibre Channel adapters located on the managed system.  There are two  logical partitions to provide redundancy at the  level. The physical Fibre Channel adapters are assigned to their respective  and support NPIV. The physical Fibre Channel ports are each connected to a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the . The two virtual Fibre Channel adapters on the  are connected to ports on two different physical Fibre Channel adapters in order to provide redundancy for the physical adapters. A single adapter could have multiple ports.  Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the  is connected to one virtual Fibre Channel adapter on a client logical partition. Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter on each client logical partition receives a pair of unique WWPNs. The client logical partition uses one WWPN to log into the SAN at any given time. The other WWPN is used when you move the client logical partition to another managed system. The client can write to the physical storage through virtual Fibre Channel adapter 1 or 2 on the client logical partition through VIOS 2. The client can also write to physical storage through virtual Fibre Channel adapter 3 or 4 on the client logical partition through VIOS 1. If a physical Fibre Channel adapter fails on VIOS 1, the client uses the other physical adapter connected to VIOS 1 or uses the paths connected through VIOS 2. If VIOS 1 fails, then the client uses the path through VIOS 2. This example does not show redundancy in the physical storage, but rather assumes it would be built into the SAN. ConsiderationsThese examples can become more complex as you add physical storage redundancy and multiple clients, but the concepts remain the same. Consider the following points:To avoid configuring the physical Fibre Channel adapter to be a single point of failure for the connection between the client logical partition and its physical storage on the SAN, do not connect two virtual Fibre Channel adapters from the same client logical partition to the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. Instead, connect each virtual Fibre Channel adapter to a different physical Fibre Channel adapter. Consider load balancing when mapping a virtual Fibre Channel adapter on the  to a physical port on the physical Fibre Channel adapter. Consider what level of redundancy already exists in the SAN to determine whether to configure multiple physical storage units. Consider using two  logical partitions. Since the  is central to communication between logical partitions and the external network, it is important to provide a level of redundancy for the . Multiple  logical partitions require more resources as well, so you should plan accordingly. NPIV technology is useful when you want to move logical partitions between servers. For example, in active , if you use the redundancy configurations as illustrated, in combination with physical adapters, you can stop all the I/O activity through the dedicated, physical adapter and direct all traffic through a virtual Fibre Channel adapter until the logical partition is successfully moved. The dedicated physical adapter would need to be connected to the same storage as the virtual path. Since you cannot migrate a physical adapter, all I/O activity is routed through the virtual path while you move the partition. After the logical partition is moved successfully, you need to set up the dedicated path (on the destination logical partition) if you want to use the same redundancy configuration you had configured on the original logical partition. Then the I/O activity can resume through the dedicated adapter, using the virtual Fibre Channel adapter as a secondary path. Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Redundancy considerations Redundancy options are available at several levels in the virtual I/O environment. Multipathing, mirroring, and RAID redundancy options exist for the  and some client logical partitions. Ethernet  is also an option for the client logical partitions, and the  provides  failover. There is also support for node failover () for nodes using virtual I/O resources. This section contains information about redundancy for both the client logical partitions and the . While these configurations help protect from the failure of one of the physical components, such as a disk or network adapter, they might cause the client logical partition to lose access to its devices if the  fails. The  can be made redundant by running a second instance of it in another logical partition. When running two instances of the , you can use LVM mirroring, multipath I/O, network interface backup, or multipath routing with dead gateway detection in the client logical partition to provide highly available access to virtual resources hosted in separate  logical partitions.

 Creating a system plan by using the HMC  You can use the  () to create a system plan, based on an existing system configuration, and then deploy that system plan to other managed systems. When you create a system plan on the , you can deploy the resulting system plan to create identical logical partition configurations on managed systems with identical hardware. The system plan contains specifications for the logical partitions and partition profiles of the managed system that you used as the basis of creating the system plan.  The new system plan also can contain hardware information that the  is able to obtain from the selected managed system. However, the amount of hardware information that the  can capture for the new system plan varies based on the method that the  uses to gather the hardware information.   When you use the  V7R7.1.0, or later, on  processor-based servers, system plans that are created by using the  do not include  () provisioning information. The  can potentially use two methods: inventory gathering and hardware discovery. For example, when using hardware discovery, the  can detect information about hardware that is unassigned to a partition or that is assigned to an inactive partition.   Ensure that you meet the requirements for using either or both of the inventory gathering and hardware discovery methods before you create your system plan. See  for more information. To create a system plan by using the , complete the following steps:  The System Plans page opens.  The Create System Plan window opens. Optional:  This option appears only if the managed system is capable of hardware discovery, and the option is selected by default.  If you do not select the  option, the  does not perform a new hardware discovery, but instead uses the data in the inventory cache on the system. The  still performs inventory gathering and retrieves hardware information for any active logical partitions on the managed server. The resulting new system plan contains hardware information from the inventory-gathering process and hardware information from the hardware inventory cache on the system.  Optional:  Now that you have a new system plan, you can export the system plan, import it onto another managed system, and deploy the system plan to that managed system.  To use the  () to create a system plan successfully, you need to ensure that your system meets a number of prerequisite conditions. The quantity and quality of hardware information that the  can capture in a new system plan varies based on your version of the  and the operating environment of the logical partition for which you are capturing information.

 Requirements for hardware discovery on the HMC By meeting the requirements for using the hardware discovery process, you can enhance the quality and quantity of data that you collect in the system plans that you create on the  (). To use the hardware discovery capability when you create a system plan, ensure that you complete the following tasks: Ensure that a minimum of 0.5 processor is available.  Ensure that a minimum of 256 MB of free memory is available.   If you do not have the minimum processor or memory available, you can meet these requirements either by shutting down one or more logical partitions or by adjusting dynamic processor and memory settings for one or more logical partitions. Ensure that all logical partitions on the managed system for which you want to use the hardware discovery process are inactive to maximize the information that the hardware discovery process can capture.  If a logical partition is active, the hardware discovery process cannot capture new information from the logical partition and instead retrieves information about the hardware assigned to the inactive logical partition from the hardware inventory cache on the managed system.  Hardware discovery does not require the use of Resource Monitoring and Control (RMC). Ensure that the  attribute for the managed system is not selected. The hardware discovery process starts partitions and powers off partitions to gather information. If the hardware discovery process powers off the only running partition on the system, the managed system powers off and system plan creation fails. To verify the setting for this system attribute, complete these steps: In the  navigation area, select . In the Tasks area, click . The Properties window for the selected managed system opens. On the  tab, verify that the  attribute is not selected, and click .   Parent topic:     |      
 Hardware discovery process on the HMC Starting with the  () Version 7 Release 3.2, and later, the  can use the hardware discovery process to capture additional information in a system plan about the hardware on a managed system.  Some systems have the capability to provide greater details about their hardware inventory through the process of hardware discovery. Hence, you can create a system plan with more extensive hardware information. By using the hardware discovery process, the  Version 7 Release 3.2, and later, can capture information about hardware that does not have a logical partition assignment and hardware with assignments to inactive logical partitions.   If you create a system plan with the intention of converting the system plan for use in the  (), you must use the latest version of the  to create the system plan. For example, to obtain disk-drive configuration information that the  can convert successfully in a system plan, you must use  Version 7 Release 3.3, or later, to have the hardware discovery process capture detailed disk-drive configuration information.  Additionally, the hardware discovery process writes hardware inventory information to a cache on the system. The hardware inventory cache ensures that a certain amount of hardware information is available on the system when you create a system plan. The  can use the data in this cache when you create a system plan to obtain more detailed hardware information for any logical partitions that are active at that time. On a system that can use hardware discovery, the hardware discovery process runs whenever the system is powered on in hardware discovery mode. When you enable this option, the system powers on in a special mode that performs the hardware discovery process and records hardware inventory information to a cache on the system. This collected information is then available for use when you display data for I/O devices or when creating a system plan.  You also can run the hardware discovery process when you create a system plan. If the managed system is capable of hardware discovery, the Create System Plan page provides an option for running hardware discovery. By using this option called , you can capture hardware configuration information for the managed system, regardless of the state of the hardware. When using this option, the  uses both the data it collects from the updated inventory cache and the data it collects from the inventory gathering process as sources of information to create the system plan.  It is recommended that you use the  option whenever you add or change the hardware while the new or changed hardware is deallocated from a partition. Otherwise, if the new or changed hardware is allocated to a partition, use this option to create the system plan when the partition is inactive. Doing so ensures that the inventory cache has the most current data possible. The following figure shows how the hardware discovery process works when you select this option. In the figure, the  uses the inventory gathering process to collect information about the active partitions and the hardware assigned to them. The  uses hardware discovery to collect information about the hardware assigned to the inactive  partition and about the unassigned hardware on the system. The  writes all the data collected by both processes to the system plan. The data collected through hardware discovery is also written to the inventory cache on the system. The  uses both sources of information to create the system-plan file. When you create a system plan and do not select the  option, the  does not perform a new hardware discovery. Instead the  uses the data in the inventory cache on the system. The  still performs inventory gathering and retrieves hardware information for any active logical partitions on the managed server. The resulting new system plan contains the hardware information that the  obtained from the inventory gathering process, and hardware information that the  obtained from the hardware inventory cache on the system.  The following figure illustrates how the hardware discovery process works when you do not select this option.  In the figure, the  uses the inventory gathering process only to collect information about the inactive partition and the hardware assigned to it. The  completes the system plan by using hardware information from the inventory cache for the active logical partitions on the managed server.  By meeting the requirements for using the hardware discovery process, you can enhance the quality and quantity of data that you collect in the system plans that you create on the  ().

 Optimizing data when creating a system plan on the HMC The quantity and quality of hardware information that the  can capture in a new system plan varies based on your version of the  and the operating environment of the logical partition for which you are capturing information. The following factors affect the quantity of hardware information in a system plan that you create: Type and level of management tool. You can capture most of the data when using an  Version 7 Release 3.2, or later, because these versions of the  have two methods that they can use to gather hardware information. Earlier versions of the  do not have the same capabilities and provide less detailed information. Operating environment. You can capture more data for logical partitions that run  than for logical partitions that run on the  or  operating system. Depending on the code level of your , the  can use different methods to capture data about the hardware on your system, as the following table describes. Method  availability Information captured Inventory gathering  Version 7 Release 3.0, and later Hardware assigned to active logical partitions Hardware discovery  Version 7 Release 3.2, and later Hardware assigned to inactive logical partitions or hardware that is not assigned to a logical partition Enhanced hardware discovery Hardware assigned to inactive logical partitions or hardware that is not assigned to a logical partition The information captured also includes SCSI disk drives on  processor-based servers, and later. The  always performs inventory gathering to capture detailed information for hardware that is assigned to an active logical partition.  Starting with the  () Version 7 Release 3.2, and later, the  can use the hardware discovery process to capture additional information in a system plan about the hardware on a managed system.

 Tips for maximizing data in a system plan on the HMC By setting up your system to optimize the hardware information that you capture in a system plan that you create by using the , you can ensure that your system plan provides you with the most valuable information possible.   To ensure that you get the most detailed and complete data in your system plans, follow these guidelines:  After you place all the hardware in the system and verify that any internal drive bay cabling and external SCSI cabling is correct, maximize the amount of data in the inventory cache and keep the inventory cache current on the managed system. You can perform this action in one of following ways:Power on your system with the Hardware Discovery option selected. Perform this action when you initially power on the system and whenever you add, remove, or move hardware on your system when making such a change requires that you power down the system to do so.  When you add, remove, or move hardware and such a changed does not require that you power off the system to do so, update the cache by creating a system plan with the  option selected. Create the system plan when the affected logical partitions are inactive. Optimize the data for your logical partitions. To optimize the amount of data collected for your logical partitions, follow these steps:Ensure that the data in the inventory cache is maximized and is current on the managed system, as described in the first guideline. Now, you can activate the logical partitions that you want to include in the system plan and complete the Create a system plan task without using the  option. This action ensures that the resulting system plan contains the most detailed and current information possible for all the hardware and logical partitions on the system. Perform this task any time that you create and activate new logical partitions. Parent topic:     |      
 System plan conversion You can convert a system-plan file that you have created by using the  () into the format that the  () uses. Converting a system plan so that you can work with it in the  has several benefits: You can reconfigure your existing system and validate the changes in  before deploying them on your server. For example, you can try adding or moving some parts, or changing the layout of the partitions.  You can plan an upgrade to a new system.  You can move workloads from one system to another. You can even move a partition configuration from one system to another and ensure that the configuration works with the existing hardware.  You can validate that the configuration on the system is what you want it to be. To convert a system plan that you created by using the  into the  format successfully, ensure that you optimize the data that you collect when you create the plan. See . You must also gather some information to prepare for the conversion and to understand the limitations of the conversion process. After you complete the conversion process, you can edit the system plan for redeployment of newly added partitions.  For example, assume that you converted an  system plan that contains two client logical partitions. You can use the  to add another logical partition and specify virtual Ethernet adapters and virtual Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) adapters for the new partition. You can then use the  to redeploy the changed system plan to configure the new logical partition.  Although you can add partitions, you cannot use  to change existing items and redeploy the system plan to the original managed system. See  to learn more about the validation considerations that can affect deployment of the system plan. Before you convert the system plan to the format that the  () uses for system plans, you must collect some information to use during the conversion process. You can convert a system plan that you created on the  () for use in the  (). However, there are some limitations in the data that the  can convert. Parent topic:  Related concepts:    |      
 Preparing for system plan conversion Before you convert the system plan to the format that the  () uses for system plans, you must collect some information to use during the conversion process. Your original system-plan file remains intact after the conversion. You will not lose any of your data. When you convert your system plan to the format that the  uses for system plans, the  gives the converted plan a new name and saves it as a new system plan. Before you convert a system plan to the format that the  uses for system plans, you must collect some information to use during the conversion process. Some of this information can help with potential conversion limitations. You must gather the following information: System attributes: You must provide the processor, server, and edition features for the system that you want to convert. The  Conversion Wizard narrows the options to those options that are valid for the system you are converting, but you must select the correct values from the list of valid options. Additional system units: If your processor feature has multiple system units that support different processor features, select the correct processor feature for each system unit from a list of valid options. Backplane: If the system in the plan that you are converting supports more than one type of backplane, select the backplane that your system uses from a list of valid options.   Logical partitions: When you convert your system-plan file to the  format, select the logical partitions that you want to include in the converted plan. Thus, you can pick just the logical partitions that you want to work with in the . For example, if you are considering moving a particular workload to a new system, you can select just those logical partitions that are used to run that workload and include them in the plan that is converted to the  format.After you know the logical partitions that you want to include, select the profile to associate with each logical partition in the converted plan. The  can only associate one profile with a logical partition. For this reason, you might be required to convert your original system plan more than once to work with different views of the data. For example, if you have logical partitions that use one profile during the day and another profile at night, select the logical partitions and profiles that are used at the same time to ensure that your converted system plan has an accurate view of how your system is used. You also might be required to select the operating system of the logical partition, if that information is unavailable in your original system plan. Expansion units: You must match the enclosures at the top and bottom of any double-high expansion units that are attached to your system. To perform this task, procure the serial numbers of the enclosures at the top and bottom of the double-high expansion unit when you use the wizard. Adapters: You must identify the adapters in each physical location on your system. Based on the vital product data that the system plan contains, the  identifies as many adapters as possible. For those adapters that the  is unable to identify, the  can provide a few possibilities for you to select from. However, if those possibilities are not correct, or if the  cannot identify any possibilities, you might be required to provide the FRU, CCIN, part number, or feature number of the correct adapter. If you do not know the number, you can find it by looking at the physical system or by using the following operating system commands to query and obtain the correct number: Operating environment Command When to use the command Use this command if you have a number of adapters to look up because the command writes the results for multiple adapters to a single output file.  Use this command to access the Hardware Resource Manager. By using this command, you can look up information about individual adapters. Use this command if you only have a few numbers to look up. Use this command if you are trying to obtain information about an adapter in a hot-plug slot. By using this command, you can view all the adapters and integrated hardware for the hot-plug slot so that you can determine the adapter for which you need the number. Use this command if you are trying to obtain information about an adapter that is not in a hot-plug slot, or if you have already used the  command to obtain adapter information for a hot-plug slot. You can find additional details about how to use these commands in the online help for the  Conversion Wizard.

 Limitations of system plan conversion  You can convert a system plan that you created on the  () for use in the  (). However, there are some limitations in the data that the  can convert. By setting up your system to optimize the hardware information that you capture when you create a system plan by using the , you can ensure that your system plan provides you with the most valuable information possible.  There are some limitations in the data that the  can convert at this time. The system plans that you create by using the  contain information about the hardware parts that are on your system. To convert one of these plans, the  maps the information about the parts back to the features that represent those parts.  In some cases, the  plans do not contain enough information for the  to do the necessary mapping conclusively. For hardware parts with inconclusive mapping information, the  performs one of the following actions to resolve the inconclusive mapping: When possible, the  Conversion Wizard prompts you for additional information about the parts during the conversion process. For example, in the case of PCI cards, the wizard prompts you to provide a part identifier for the card or to select the card from a list.  The wizard identifies the part based on what it knows from the  system plan, even if the information is not conclusive.  The wizard disregards the part if the level of information in the plan is insufficient to do any kind of identification. The following table shows some specific examples of parts or configurations that are more difficult to convert and what  does when it encounters them. Part or configuration  action during conversion Logical partitions with more than one partition profile  can only convert one profile per logical partition. SPT prompts you to select the profile you want to use for that partition during the conversion process. Cards that are referred to by more than one partition profile  assigns the card to the first profile it encounters that references the card and discards all other references to the card. CD, DVD, or optical storage  does not convert these devices. Disk drives in a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) array  does not convert any information about these drives. The following table describes the type of hardware information that you can expect to see in a system plan that you convert to  format. The type of information that you can expect is based on the management tool that you use to create the plan and the types of logical partitions in the system plan.

With the , you can copy logical partitions from a system in one system plan to either another system in the same system plan or to a different system in another system plan. For example, you can build up system plans that contain your own sample logical partitions, and then copy one or more of these sample logical partitions into a new system plan that you are creating. You also can copy a logical partition within the same system plan. For example, you can define the attributes of a partition within a system plan and then make 7 copies of that partition within the same plan. You can export a system plan as a .cfr file and import it into the marketing configurator (eConfig) tool to use for ordering a system. When you import the .cfr file into the eConfig tool, the tool populates your order with the information from the .cfr file. However, the .cfr file does not contain all the information that the eConfig tool requires. You will need to enter all required information before you can submit your order. If you make any changes to the hardware assignments or placement in the system, the  validates the changes to ensure that the resulting system fulfills the minimum hardware requirements and hardware placement requirements for the logical partitions.

 System plans A system plan is a specification of the hardware and the logical partitions contained in one or more systems. You can use system plans in a number of ways that are useful for managing your system.  For example, you can use a system plan to create a record of hardware and logical partition configuration data for a system, to create a set of system specifications for ordering a system, or to deploy logical partitions to a system. A system plan is stored in a system-plan file, which has a file suffix of .sysplan. A system-plan file can contain more than one system plan, although multiple plans in a single file are not common. After you create a system plan, you also can view, delete, and export the system plan.  System plans have a number of valuable uses. For example, you can use system plans to accomplish the following goals: You can create a system plan as a means of capturing up-to-date system documentation. The system plan provides a record of the hardware and logical partition configuration of the managed system at a given time.  You can use a system plan that you create for system documentation as part of your disaster recovery planning. On the  (), you can export the system-plan file to an off-site location or to removable media for off-site storage so that you have the system documentation that you need available if you must recover a managed system.  Although the system plan contains a large amount of system configuration information, it does not contain all the configuration information for a system. Consequently, the system plan is not intended to provide complete system documentation. You can use system plans as audit records to track system hardware resources for accounting and accountability purposes by exporting the information in them to a spreadsheet.  You can use system plans to help you plan new workloads that require additional system and hardware resources. You can use a system plan, along with appropriate capacity planning information, to make decisions about whether your current system can handle a new workload.  You can create a system plan based on one managed system and deploy the system plan on another system to more quickly and easily create logical partitions on that system.  You can use the  () to design a managed system based on workload data from your current systems, based on new workloads that you want the managed system to support, based on sample systems that are provided with the utility, or based on your own custom specifications. You can then use the system plan to order a system based on the specifications that the system plan contains. Also, you can use the  to deploy the system plan to configure an existing system when the target system meets the requirements for deployment. You can create a system plan by using one of the following methods: IBM  (): You can create a system plan to capture the configuration of a system or systems that you want to order.

 System plans on the HMC You can use system plans with the  () to perform a number of high-level system management tasks.  You can use system plans with the  to accomplish the following goals: You can deploy a system plan that you create based on one system that an  manages to other systems that the  manages with identical hardware as in the system plan. Any internal drive bays and external SCSI cables also must be cabled in an identical manner on the target system. In this way, you can rapidly configure and use other, similar systems in your business. You can export a system plan from one  to another  and use it to deploy the system plan to other systems that the target  manages with identical hardware, and identical cabling, as that in the system plan. In this case and the previous case, you can use the system plan to create logical partitions on new managed systems that do not already have logical partitions created on them.  You can convert a system plan that you created by using the  for use in the  (). However, the  Conversion Wizard can convert a limited amount of hardware information from the original system plan. How much the wizard can convert depends on the operating environment of the logical partition and the version of the HMC that you used to create the system plan. You must use the  to manually specify any missing or incomplete information.  For example, assume that you converted an  system plan that contains two client logical partitions. You can use the  to add another logical partition and to specify Ethernet adapters, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) disks, and virtual Ethernet adapters for the new partition. You can then use the  to redeploy the modified system plan to configure the new logical partition.  After you create or convert a system plan on the , you can use the  to deploy the system plan. However, the  must validate this system plan successfully before you can deploy it. The  only supports deployment of system plans on which you have created logical partitions and logical partition profiles. It does not support deployment of system plans on which you have modified attributes of existing logical partitions and logical partition profiles. For example, if you use the  to add a logical partition and assign unassigned resources to the logical partition, you can deploy the system plan by using the . However, if you use the  to move resources from an existing logical partition to a new logical partition, you cannot deploy the system plan by using the .

Before you shut down the  logical partition, complete the following tasks:If an integrated server is active on the system, shut down the integrated server using  options. Ensure that all jobs are completed and all applications are ended. Ensure that your partition profiles are updated with any dynamic partitioning resource changes that you want to keep when you restart the logical partition.  The correct way to shut down an  logical partition from the  is to open an  5250 emulator session and run the PowerÂ® Down System (PWRDWNSYS) command.  To shut down an  logical partition from the , follow these steps:  The system will only shut down the  logical partition you selected. The PWRDWNSYS command does not affect other  logical partitions on your system. If you enter the PWRDWNSYS command with the RESTART(*YES) option, the operating system restarts, and the resource specifications of the logical partition remain the same. If you do not use the RESTART(*YES) option, then the logical partition shuts down completely, and other logical partitions will be able to take and use the resources that were used by the logical partition. Also, when you reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile, the partition profile overlays the resource specifications of the logical partition with the resource specifications in the partition profile. Any resource changes that you made to the logical partition using dynamic partitioning are lost when you reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile. If the logical partition is set to start automatically when the managed system starts, you can preserve the resource specifications on that logical partition by restarting the entire managed system using the Partition autostart power-on mode. When the logical partitions start automatically, the logical partitions have the resource specifications that the logical partitions had when you shut down the managed system.   Using these methods can cause an abnormal shutdown and can result in loss of data. You can perform a delayed shutdown of a logical partition using the  (). Using delayed shutdown is equivalent to using the power button on the remote control panel. Use delayed shutdown only when you must shut down a logical partition, and the PWRDWNSYS command does not work.

  Shutting down  logical partitions using Operations Console You can shut down  logical partitions using Operations Console.  Before you shut down the  logical partition, complete the following: If an integrated server is active on the system, shut down the integrated server using  options. Ensure that all jobs are completed and all applications are ended. Ensure that your partition profiles are updated with any dynamic partitioning resource changes that you want to keep when you restart the logical partition.  The correct way to shut down a logical partition is by using the control language (CL) command PowerÂ® Down System (PWRDWNSYS).  From an  command line, type PWRDWNSYS OPTION (*CNTRLD) DELAY (600) and press Enter. The system will only shut down the  logical partition you selected. The PWRDWNSYS command does not affect other  logical partitions on your system.  If you enter the PWRDWNSYS command with the RESTART(*YES) option, the operating system restarts, and the resource specifications of the logical partition remain the same. If you do not use the RESTART(*YES) option, then the logical partition shuts down completely, and other logical partitions will be able to take and use the resources that were used by the logical partition. Also, when you reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile, the partition profile overlays the resource specifications of the logical partition with the resource specifications in the partition profile. Any resource changes that you made to the logical partition using dynamic partitioning are lost when you reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile. If the logical partition is set to start automatically when the managed system starts, you can preserve the resource specifications on that logical partition by restarting the entire managed system using the Partition autostart power-on mode. When the logical partitions start automatically, the logical partitions have the resource specifications that the logical partitions had when you shut down the managed system. If the PWRDWNSYS command does not work, you can use the remote control panel through Operations Console to use control panel functions through a PC. The graphical user interface of the remote control panel looks similar to the physical control panel. The remote control panel installs through Operations Console. Using the remote control panel to shut down the  logical partition can result in an abnormal IPL and loss of data.  Delayed shutdownUse delayed shutdown only when you must shut down a logical partition, and when the PWRDWNSYS command does not work.    When you use the delayed shutdown option, the logical partition waits a predetermined amount of time to shut down. This allows the logical partition time to end jobs and write data to disks. If the logical partition is unable to shut down within the predetermined amount of time, it will end abnormally and the next restart might take a long time.  Immediate shutdownUse immediate shutdown only when an  logical partition cannot shut down using PWRDWNSYS or delayed shutdown.    When you use the immediate shutdown option, the system turns off without any preset delay.   This might cause an abnormal IPL of the  logical partition and possibly cause loss of data.    Use the remote control panel to perform a delayed shutdown or an immediate shutdown. The power button will start a delayed shutdown and function 8 will start an immediate shutdown of a system.

 Restarting and shutting down  in a logical partition At times you will need to perform an initial program load (IPL) or shut down an  logical partition. For example, if you want to apply a delayed fix to , you must perform an IPL before  can apply the fix.  The preferred method for restarting and shutting down  logical partitions is through the  command line. The  () does not shut down the  operating system before it shuts down the logical partition. Using the  to restart or shut down an  logical partition can result in an abnormal IPL and the loss of data. However, you might need to use the  to change the operating mode or IPL type of the  logical partition before you restart or shut down the  logical partition using the  command line. It is important to remember that, when you perform an IPL of an  logical partition, you are powering off only the logical partition and not the entire managed system. Other logical partitions on your managed system continue to run when you perform an IPL on the  logical partition. However, when you shut down the last logical partition that is running on a managed system, then the managed system is set to power off automatically by default. If you want, you can set the managed system properties on the  so that the managed system remains powered on when you shut down the last running logical partition. You can change the operating mode for an  logical partition using the  (). The operating mode for an  logical partition determines the number of options that are presented to the operator for consideration during and after the initial program load (IPL).

 Creating a system plan by using the HMC  You can use the  () to create a system plan, based on an existing system configuration, and then deploy that system plan to other managed systems. When you create a system plan on the , you can deploy the resulting system plan to create identical logical partition configurations on managed systems with identical hardware. The system plan contains specifications for the logical partitions and partition profiles of the managed system that you used as the basis of creating the system plan.  The new system plan also can contain hardware information that the  is able to obtain from the selected managed system. However, the amount of hardware information that the  can capture for the new system plan varies based on the method that the  uses to gather the hardware information.   When you use the  V7R7.1.0, or later, on  processor-based servers, system plans that are created by using the  do not include  () provisioning information. The  can potentially use two methods: inventory gathering and hardware discovery. For example, when using hardware discovery, the  can detect information about hardware that is unassigned to a partition or that is assigned to an inactive partition.   Ensure that you meet the requirements for using either or both of the inventory gathering and hardware discovery methods before you create your system plan. See  for more information. To create a system plan by using the , complete the following steps:  The System Plans page opens.  The Create System Plan window opens. Optional:  This option appears only if the managed system is capable of hardware discovery, and the option is selected by default.  If you do not select the  option, the  does not perform a new hardware discovery, but instead uses the data in the inventory cache on the system. The  still performs inventory gathering and retrieves hardware information for any active logical partitions on the managed server. The resulting new system plan contains hardware information from the inventory-gathering process and hardware information from the hardware inventory cache on the system.  Optional:  Now that you have a new system plan, you can export the system plan, import it onto another managed system, and deploy the system plan to that managed system.  To use the  () to create a system plan successfully, you need to ensure that your system meets a number of prerequisite conditions.

 Changing the size of the shared memory pool You can increase or decrease the amount of physical memory assigned to the shared memory pool by using the  (). You must be a super administrator of operator of the  to change the size of the shared memory pool. If there is not enough physical memory available in the system by which to increase the amount of memory assigned to the shared memory pool, you can release to the hypervisor the physical memory that is currently assigned to dedicated memory partitions that are shut down. The hypervisor can then assign the released physical memory to the shared memory pool. If the shared memory pool has insufficient physical memory by which to decrease the amount of memory in the shared memory pool, you can release to the hypervisor the I/O entitled memory that is currently assigned to shared memory partitions that are shut down. The hypervisor can then remove the released physical memory from the shared memory pool. To change the size of the shared memory pool, complete the following steps:  You can enter the size in a combination of gigabytes (GB) plus megabytes (MB). If you need to assign more memory to the shared memory pool than the current maximum pool size, you can also enter a new value for the maximum pool size. If there is not enough physical memory available in the system by which to increase the maximum pool size, the Release Memory Resources window is displayed. Select dedicated memory partitions that are shut down until the available memory is equal to or greater than the requested memory and click . If the amount of memory by which you want to decrease the size of the shared memory pool is greater than the amount of available physical memory in the shared memory pool, the Release Memory Resources window is displayed.  (For example, the amount of available physical memory in the shared memory pool is 8 GB and you want to decrease the size of the shared memory pool from 32 GB to 20 GB, a difference of 12 GB, which is greater than 8 GB.) Select shared memory partitions that are shut down until the amount of memory by which you want to decrease the size of the shared memory pool is equal to or less than the available physical memory in the shared memory pool, and click .  Parent topic:  Related tasks:         
 Determining the size of the shared memory pool You need to consider the degree to which you want to overcommit the physical memory in the shared memory pool, the performance of the workloads when running in a shared memory configuration that is overcommitted, and the minimum and maximum boundaries of the shared memory pool. To determine the size of the shared memory pool, consider the following factors:     In general, more workloads perform better in logically overcommitted configurations than physically overcommitted configurations. Consider limiting the degree to which you physically overcommit the shared memory pool.   After you activate the shared memory partitions, you can view statistics about how the operating systems use their I/O entitled memory and adjust the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partitions accordingly.  To ensure that you can successfully activate the shared memory partitions, assign at least the following amount of physical memory to the shared memory pool: (the sum of the minimum logical memory that is assigned to all of the shared memory partitions that you plan to run concurrently) + (the required 256 MB of reserved firmware memory). Parent topic:  Related tasks:         
 Preparing to configure shared memory on a system that is managed by an  Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to determine the size of the shared memory pool, the amount of memory to assign to each shared memory partition, the number of paging space devices to assign to the shared memory pool that you assign to the shared memory pool. Before you start, verify that your system meets the requirements for configuring shared memory. For instructions, see . To prepare to configure the shared memory pool and shared memory partitions, complete the following steps:    You can apply the same general guidelines that you might use to assign the desired, minimum, and maximum dedicated memory to logical partitions that use dedicated memory. For example: Do not assign the maximum logical memory to a value that is higher than the amount of logical memory that you plan to dynamically add to the shared memory partition. Set the minimum logical memory to a value that is high enough for the shared memory partition to successfully activate.  For instructions, see .   The  assigns one paging space device to each shared memory partition that is active. Thus, the fewest number of paging space devices that must be assigned to the shared memory pool is equal to the number of shared memory partitions that you plan to run simultaneously. For example, you assign ten shared memory partitions to the shared memory pool and you plan to run eight of the shared memory partitions simultaneously. Thus, you assign at least eight paging space devices to the shared memory pool.  For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition that you identified in step 1b.  For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition that you identified in step 1b multiplied by 129/128. For example, you plan to create an  shared memory partition with a maximum logical memory size of 16 GB. The paging space device must be at least 16.125 GB. Consider creating paging space devices that are large enough to be used by shared memory partitions with multiple partition profiles.  Paging space devices that are accessed by a single  (VIOS) logical partition (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) can be located in physical storage on the server or on a SAN. Paging space devices that are redundantly accessed by two paging VIOS partitions must be located on a SAN.   A paging VIOS partition provides access to the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool. A paging VIOS partition can be any active  (version 2.1.1, or later) that has access to the paging space devices that you plan to assign to the shared memory pool.   You can assign one or two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool: When you assign a single paging VIOS partition to the shared memory pool, it must have access to all of the paging space devices that you plan to assign to the shared memory pool.  When you assign two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool, each paging space device that you plan to assign to the shared memory pool must be accessible to at least one paging VIOS partition. However, usually when you assign two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool, they redundantly access one or more paging space devices.  Determine which shared memory partitions to configure to use redundant paging VIOS partitions. For each shared memory partition, this means that both paging VIOS partitions can access the shared memory partition's paging space device. Determine which paging VIOS partition to assign as the primary paging VIOS partition and which paging VIOS partition to assign as the secondary paging VIOS partition for each shared memory partition. The hypervisor uses the primary paging VIOS partition to access the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the primary VIOS partition becomes unavailable, the hypervisor uses the secondary paging VIOS partition to access the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition.   To read and write data between the paging space devices and the shared memory pool, the paging VIOS partitions require additional processing resources. The amount of additional processing resources that are needed depends on the frequency that the paging VIOS partition reads and writes the data. The more frequently that the paging VIOS partition reads and writes the data, the more frequently the paging VIOS partition performs I/O operations. More I/O operations require more processing power. In general, the frequency that the paging VIOS partition reads and writes data can be affected by the following factors:The degree to which the shared memory partitions are overcommitted. In general, greatly overcommitted shared memory partitions require the paging VIOS partition to read and write data more often than slightly overcommitted shared memory partitions.  The I/O rates of the storage subsystem on which the paging space devices are located. In general, paging space devices with faster I/O rates (such as a SAN) enable the paging VIOS partition to read and write data more often than paging space devices with slower I/O rates (such as storage in the server). You can use the  (WLE) to determine the number of processor resources that are needed for paging VIOS partitions. Parent topic:  Related concepts:

Running Running You can change the  assignment of one of the paging  partitions. You cannot change the  assignment of both paging  partitions at the same time. Running Shut down You can change the  assignment of only the paging  partition that is shut down. Shut down Running You can change the  assignment of only the paging  partition that is shut down. Shut down Shut down You cannot change the  assignment of either paging  partition. Instead, you can remove the paging  partition that you do not want to change and then change the  assignment of the remaining paging  partition. In this situation, you also need to add the paging space devices to which the changed paging  partition has access. When you change the  assignment of a paging  partition, the following configuration changes occur to the paging space devices: Paging space devices that were common become independent if only one paging  partition can access them. Paging space devices that were common remain common if both paging  partitions can access them. (These are paging space devices to which all three  logical partitions have access. The three  logical partitions are the two  logical partitions that were originally assigned to the shared memory pool as paging  partitions plus the  logical partition that you assigned as a paging  partition when you changed the  assignment of a paging  partition.) Paging space devices that were independent become common if both paging  partitions can access them. When you change the  assignment of a paging  partition, the  changes the configuration of the shared memory partitions to use the  logical partition that you assigned as the paging  partition. When you activate the shared memory partition, the  automatically reflects the name of the  logical partition that you assigned as the paging  partition in the partition profile. The following examples explain this automatic change in more detail: A shared memory partition uses only one paging  partition and you change the  assignment of that paging  partition from _A to _B. When you activate the shared memory partition, the  automatically shows _B as the paging  partition in the partition profile. Two paging  partitions are assigned to the shared memory pool. _A is assigned to the shared memory pool as PVP1 and _B is assigned to the shared memory pool as PVP2. A shared memory partition uses PVP1 as the primary paging  partition and PVP2 as the secondary paging  partition. You change the  assignment of PVP1 from _A to _C.

Because you removed a paging  partition from the shared memory pool, you changed the  assignment of the only paging  partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool.  You changed the  assignment of a paging  partition that provided independent paging space devices to shared memory partitions. The independent paging space devices to which the current paging  partition has access must be assigned to the shared memory pool for the shared memory partitions to continue to use independent paging space devices. Activate all of the shared memory partitions that you previously shut down so that your changes can take effect. For instructions, see .

Changing the memory weight changes the probability that the shared memory partition receives physical memory from the shared memory pool in relation to other shared memory partitions. You can create multiple partition profiles for a logical partition by using the  (). Some of the partition profiles can specify dedicated memory and some of the partition profiles can specify shared memory.

 Managing  memory dynamically You can add, remove, and move physical memory dynamically to and from running logical partitions using the  (). This allows you to adjust the physical memory allocated to each logical partition without having to shut down the logical partitions. When a DPO operation is in progress and you want to dynamically add, remove, or move physical memory to, or from running logical partitions, you must either wait for the DPO operation to complete, or manually stop the DPO operation.  Dynamic memory changes on  logical partitions affect the base memory pool of the logical partitions (*BASE pool). Private memory pools or shared memory pools are not affected. Dynamic memory changes cannot cause the amount of memory in the base pool to fall below the minimum amount of memory required in the base pool (as determined by the base storage minimum size (QBASPOOL) system value). If a dynamic memory change would cause the base pool to fall below this amount, the system releases excess memory pages only after keeping the minimum amount of memory required in the base pool. To prevent any data loss during dynamic memory movement, the system first writes any data from memory pages to disk before making the memory pages available to another logical partition. Depending on the amount of memory you have requested to move, this might take some time.   Memory in each logical partition operates within its assigned minimum and maximum values. The full amount of memory that you assign to a logical partition might not be available for the logical partition to use. Static memory overhead that is required to support the assigned maximum memory affects the reserved or hidden memory amount. This static memory overhead also influences the minimum memory size of a logical partition.  If resources are moved dynamically, the configuration change is temporary and is not reflected in the partition profile. This means that all configuration changes will be lost the next time the partition profile is activated. If you want to save your new logical partition configuration, either change the partition profile or save the logical partition configuration to a new partition profile.

 Managing logical partition resources dynamically You use the  () to add, remove, or move processor, memory, and I/O resources between running logical partitions without restarting the logical partitions or the managed system.  Dynamic resource management is used only for running logical partitions. If a logical partition is not running, you cannot add resources to that logical partition dynamically or remove resources from that logical partition dynamically. Also, if you shut down a logical partition, you cannot move resources dynamically to or from that logical partition. (However, the resources that were used by that logical partition can be added dynamically to running logical partitions.) You can change the resource allocations for an idle logical partition by changing the properties of the partition profiles used by that logical partition. When you start the logical partition using one of the changed partition profiles, the managed system applies the changes to the logical partition.  processor-based servers with firmware at level 7.6, or later, can support the Dynamic Platform Optimizer (DPO) function.  DPO is a hypervisor function initiated from the  (). DPO rearranges logical partition processors and memory on the system to improve the affinity between processors and memory of logical partitions. When DPO is running, mobility operations that target the system that is being optimized are blocked. Also, when DPO is running, many virtualization features are blocked. When a DPO operation is in progress and you want to dynamically add, remove, or move physical memory to or from running logical partitions, you must either wait for the DPO operation to complete or manually stop the DPO operation. You can run the  command from the  () command line on  processor-based servers with firmware at level 7.6, or later, to start a Dynamic Platform Optimizer (DPO) operation or stop a DPO operation that is currently running.  Scheduled operation of the Dynamic Platform Optimizer (DPO) function is supported on  processor-based servers with firmware at level 7.6, or later. The  () must be at Version 7.8.0 or later.

 Dynamic Platform Optimizer   processor-based servers with firmware at level 7.6, or later, can support the Dynamic Platform Optimizer (DPO) function.  DPO is a hypervisor function initiated from the  (). DPO rearranges logical partition processors and memory on the system to improve the affinity between processors and memory of logical partitions. When DPO is running, mobility operations that target the system that is being optimized are blocked. Also, when DPO is running, many virtualization features are blocked. When a DPO operation is in progress and you want to dynamically add, remove, or move physical memory to or from running logical partitions, you must either wait for the DPO operation to complete or manually stop the DPO operation. To help assess when DPO might be beneficial, you can use the  to determine affinity scores for the system and logical partitions by using the  command. An affinity score is a measure of the processor-memory affinity on the system or for a partition. The score is a number in the range 0 - 100, 0 represents the worst affinity and 100 represents perfect affinity. Based on the system  configuration, a  score of 100 might not be attainable. A partition that has no processor and memory resources does not have an affinity score, and none is displayed for the score on the command line, when you run the  command.  In addition to manually running DPO by using the  command, you can schedule  DPO operations on  processor-based servers with firmware at level 7.6, or later. The  must be at Version 7.8.0 or later. The following conditions apply to the DPO operation:The current server affinity score of the managed system is less than or equal to the server affinity threshold that you provided. The affinity delta (which is the potential score minus the current score) of the managed system is greater than or equal to the affinity delta threshold of the server that you provided.

A  shared memory partition supports the dynamic addition and removal of I/O entitled memory resources only if the DynamicRM tool package is installed on the  shared memory partition. To download the DynamicRM tool package, see the  Web site. You can increase the amount of I/O entitled memory that is assigned to a shared memory partition when the sum of I/O entitled memory that is assigned to all shared memory partitions in the shared memory pool is less than the size of the shared memory pool minus the required amount of reserved firmware memory. If there is not enough physical memory in the shared memory pool by which to increase the I/O entitled memory to the amount specified, you can release to the hypervisor the physical memory that is currently assigned to other shared memory partitions that are shut down. The hypervisor can then assign the released physical memory to the shared memory partition that needs more I/O entitled memory. You can decrease the amount of I/O entitled memory that is assigned to a shared memory partition only when the shared memory partition requires less physical memory for its I/O devices than the amount of I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition. For example, you assign 128 MB of I/O entitled memory to a shared memory partition. The shared memory partition requires a minimum of 64 MB for its I/O devices.

 Determining the I/O entitled memory for a shared memory partition After you create a new logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) or you dynamically add or remove a virtual adapter, you can use memory statistics that are displayed by the  () to dynamically increase and decrease the amount of I/O entitled memory assigned to a shared memory partition. The I/O entitled memory set for a shared memory partition needs to be high enough to ensure the progress of I/O operations, and low enough to ensure adequate memory use among all the shared memory partitions in the shared memory pool. The operating system manages the I/O entitled memory allocated to a shared memory partition by distributing it among the I/O device drivers. The operating system monitors how the device drivers use the I/O entitled memory, and sends usage data to the . You can view the data in the  and dynamically adjust the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to a shared memory partition.  To determine the I/O entitled memory for a shared memory partition, complete the following steps using the :    The Partition Properties page is displayed.  The Memory Statistics panel is displayed.   If the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is less than the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value, the operating system is able to run all of the workload's I/O operations simultaneously without using all of its assigned I/O entitled memory. In this situation, you can decrease the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value to the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value and continue to maintain unconstrained I/O performance. If the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is equal to the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value, the I/O operations of the shared memory partition might or might not be constrained by the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value as follows:The Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value does not constrain the I/O operations: The operating system runs all of the workload's I/O operations simultaneously and uses all of the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to it. In this situation, the shared memory partition operates with the smallest amount of I/O entitled memory necessary to maintain unconstrained I/O performance. The Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value constrains the I/O operations: The workload requires more physical memory for I/O operations than the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value, so the operating system must delay some I/O operations so that the shared memory partition operates within the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value. In this situation, you can increase the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value so that it no longer constrains I/O performance. If you are unsure as to whether the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value constrains the I/O operations of the shared memory partition, you can increase the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition, reset the data collector, and view the memory statistics again. Repeat this process until the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value no longer equals the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value. You can also view statistics, for  shared memory partitions, that show the number and frequency of delayed I/O operations. For instructions about how to view these statistics, see .  For instructions, see . (Dynamically changing the I/O entitled memory also changes the I/O entitled memory mode to the manual mode.)   For example, you create a shared memory partition with eight virtual adapters. You activate the shared memory partition and the  automatically assigns 128 MB of I/O entitled memory to the shared memory partition. After some time, you view the memory statistics for the shared memory partition and see that the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is 96 MB. You dynamically decrease the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition from 128 MB to 96 MB and reset the data collector. After some time, you view the memory statistics for the shared memory partition and see that the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is 88 MB. Because 88 MB is similar to 96 MB, you decide to leave the I/O entitled memory assigned to 96 MB for the shared memory partition. ExamplesCreating a new shared memory partition You activate the new shared memory partition. The  automatically sets the I/O entitled memory for the shared memory partition. After some time, you view the memory statistics and see that the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is much less than the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value. You dynamically decrease the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition to the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value and reset the data collector. (Dynamically decreasing the I/O entitled memory also changes the I/O entitled memory mode to the manual mode.) After some time, you view the memory statistics again and determine that the new Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is only slightly less than the new Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value, and no further adjustment is necessary. Dynamically adding a virtual adapter to a shared memory partition in the auto I/O entitled memory mode You dynamically add a virtual adapter to a shared memory partition. The  automatically increases the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition. After some time, you view the memory statistics and see that the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is much less than the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value. You dynamically decrease the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition to the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value and reset the data collector. (Dynamically decreasing the I/O entitled memory also changes the I/O entitled memory mode to the manual mode.) After some time, you view the memory statistics again and determine that the new Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is only slightly less than the new Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value, and no further adjustment is necessary. Dynamically adding a virtual adapter to a shared memory partition in the manual I/O entitled memory mode You ensure that the shared memory partition has enough I/O entitled memory to accommodate the new adapter by dynamically increasing the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition. You dynamically add a virtual adapter to the shared memory partition. After some time, you view the memory statistics and see that the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is much less than the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value. You dynamically decrease the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition to the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value and reset the data collector. After some time, you view the memory statistics again and determine that the new Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is only slightly less than the new Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value, and no further adjustment is necessary. Dynamically removing a virtual adapter from a shared memory partition You dynamically remove a virtual adapter from a shared memory partition. If the I/O entitled memory mode is in the auto mode, the  automatically decreases the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition. You reset the data collector. After some time, you view the memory statistics and see that the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is much less than the Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value. You dynamically decrease the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition to the Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value and reset the data collector. (If the I/O entitled memory mode is in the auto mode, dynamically decreasing the I/O entitled memory also changes the I/O entitled memory mode to the manual mode.) After some time, you view the memory statistics again and determine that the new Maximum I/O Entitled Memory Used value is only slightly less than the new Assigned I/O Entitled Memory value, and no further adjustment is necessary. The following example is another way to accomplish this example for  shared memory partitions: Determine the amount of physical memory that the virtual adapter (that you plan to remove) currently uses by running the  from the  command line. If the I/O entitled memory mode is in the auto mode, dynamically change the I/O entitled memory mode to the manual mode by running the  command from the  command line. Using the  graphical interface, dynamically remove the virtual adapter. Using the  graphical interface, dynamically decrease the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition by the amount that you identified in step .

 I/O entitled memory I/O entitled memory is the maximum amount of physical memory (from the shared memory pool) that is guaranteed to be available to a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) for its I/O devices at any given time. Each shared memory partition is entitled to some portion of the shared memory pool so that the I/O devices that are assigned to the shared memory partition have access to physical memory during I/O operations. If the minimum amount of memory that I/O devices require for I/O operations does not reside in the shared memory pool for as long as the device needs the memory, the device fails. Virtual adapters that are entitled to physical memory from the shared memory pool include virtual SCSI adapters, virtual Ethernet adapters, and virtual Fibre Channel adapters. Virtual serial adapters are not entitled to physical memory from the shared memory pool.  The following figure shows a shared memory partition with I/O entitled memory. The figure shows a shared memory partition with 128 MB of I/O entitled memory. The shared memory partition uses 64 MB of physical memory for its I/O devices, which is less than its I/O entitled memory of 128 MB. As depicted in the previous figure, a shared memory partition might not use all of its I/O entitled memory at any given time. Unused portions of the I/O entitled memory assigned to a shared memory partition are available to the hypervisor to allocate to other shared memory partitions, if necessary. The hypervisor does not reserve unused portions of I/O entitled memory for the shared memory partition to use in the future. However, the hypervisor guarantees that the shared memory partition can use the entire portion of the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to it as needed. If the shared memory partition later requires some of its unused I/O entitled memory, the hypervisor must allocate enough physical memory from the shared memory pool to satisfy the new I/O memory requirement, without exceeding the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition. For example, you assign 128 MB of I/O entitled memory to a shared memory partition. The shared memory partition uses only 64 MB for its I/O devices. Thus, the hypervisor allocates 64 MB of physical memory from the shared memory pool to the shared memory partition for its I/O devices. The remaining 64 MB is available to the hypervisor to allocate to other shared memory partitions, if necessary. Later, you add two virtual adapters to the shared memory partition, each requiring 16 MB of memory. Thus, the shared memory partition needs an additional 32 MB of physical memory for its I/O devices. Because the shared memory partition currently uses only 64 MB of physical memory for its I/O devices and the shared memory partition is entitled to use up to 128 MB for its I/O devices, the hypervisor allocates an additional 32 MB of physical memory from the shared memory pool to the shared memory partition to accommodate the new virtual adapters. The shared memory partition now uses 96 MB of physical memory from the shared memory pool for its I/O devices. Because unused portions of I/O entitled memory are available to the hypervisor to allocate elsewhere, it is possible for the amount of total physical memory that the hypervisor allocates from the shared memory pool to a shared memory partition to be less than the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition. The following figure shows this situation. The figure shows a shared memory partition with 128 MB of I/O entitled memory. The shared memory partition uses 64 MB of physical memory for its I/O devices. The unused portion of the I/O entitled memory, 64 MB, is available to the hypervisor to allocate to other shared memory partitions, if necessary. The hypervisor allocates a total of 96 MB of physical memory from the shared memory pool to the shared memory partition, which is less than the I/O entitled memory of 128 MB. When you create a shared memory partition, the  () and the  (IVM) automatically set the I/O entitled memory for the shared memory partition. When you activate a shared memory partition, the  and IVM set the I/O entitled memory mode to the auto mode. In the auto mode, the  and IVM automatically adjust the I/O entitled memory for the shared memory partition when you add or remove virtual adapters. The I/O entitled memory mode can also be set to the manual mode. You can dynamically change the I/O entitled memory mode to the manual mode and then dynamically change the I/O entitled memory for the shared memory partition. When you add or remove a virtual adapter to or from the shared memory partition in manual mode, the  and IVM do not automatically adjust the I/O entitled memory. Therefore, you might need to dynamically adjust the I/O entitled memory when you dynamically add or remove adapters to or from the shared memory partition. On -managed systems, you use the graphical interface to dynamically change the I/O entitled memory mode. When the I/O entitled memory mode is in the manual mode, you can also use the graphical interface to dynamically change the amount of I/O entitled memory that is assigned to a shared memory partition. On IVM-managed systems, you use the  command to dynamically change the I/O entitled memory mode. When the I/O entitled memory mode is in the manual mode, you can also use the  command to dynamically change the amount of I/O entitled memory that is assigned to a shared memory partition. When you restart a shared memory partition, the I/O entitled memory mode is set to the auto mode regardless of what the I/O entitled memory mode was set to before you restarted the shared memory partition.  When the amount of physical memory that a shared memory partition uses for its I/O devices is equal to the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition, the shared memory partition cannot use any more physical memory for its I/O devices. In this situation, the following actions can occur: The operating system that runs in the shared memory partition manages the I/O operations so that the workload that runs in the shared memory partition operates within the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the workload attempts to use more physical memory for I/O operations than the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition, the operating system delays some I/O operations while it runs other I/O operations. In this situation, the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition constrains the I/O configuration of the shared memory partition because the operating system does not have enough physical memory to run all of the I/O operations simultaneously. When you dynamically add a virtual adapter to the shared memory partition and the I/O entitled memory mode is in the manual mode, the I/O configuation of the shared memory partition might become constrained, or the adapter might fail when you attempt to configure it. If the adapter fails, then there is not enough I/O entitled memory assigned to the shared memory partition to accommodate the new adapter. To resolve the problem, you can dynamically increase the amount of I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition, or you can remove some existing virtual adapters from the shared memory partition. When you remove virtual adapters from the shared memory partition, the physical memory that those adapters were using becomes available for the new adapter.  When you dynamically add a virtual adapter to the shared memory partition and the I/O entitled memory mode is in the auto mode, the  and IVM automatically increase the I/O entitled memory assigned to the shared memory partition to accommodate the new adapter. If the  and IVM cannot increase the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition, there is not enough physical memory available in the shared memory pool for the hypervisor to allocate to the shared memory partition and the adapter cannot be assigned to the shared memory partition. To resolve the problem, you can add physical memory to the shared memory pool, or you can remove some existing virtual adapters from the shared memory partition. When you remove virtual adapters from the shared memory partition, the physical memory that those adapters were using becomes available for the new adapter. To improve performance and memory use, , IVM provide statistics about how the operating system uses the physical memory allocated to it for its I/O devices. You can use these statistics to manually adjust the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to a shared memory partition.  Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks: Related information:         
 Data flow for shared memory partitions When the operating system that runs in a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) needs to access data, the data must reside in the shared memory pool. Systems with overcommitted memory configurations require the hypervisor and at least one  (VIOS) logical partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partition) to move data between the shared memory pool and the paging space devices as needed. In a shared memory configuration that is physically overcommitted (where the sum of the logical memory that is currently used by all the shared memory partitions is greater than the amount of memory in the shared memory pool), the hypervisor stores some of the logical memory that belongs to a shared memory partition in the shared memory pool and some of the logical memory in a paging space device. In order for the operating system in a shared memory partition to access its memory, the memory must be in the shared memory pool. Thus, when the operating system needs to access data that is stored on the paging space device, the hypervisor works with a paging VIOS partition to move the data from the paging space device to the shared memory pool so that the operating system can access it. The following figure shows the data flow for shared memory. In general, the data flows as follows: The operating system that runs in a shared memory partition attempts to access data.If the data is in the shared memory pool, processing continues with step . If the data is not in the shared memory pool, a page fault occurred. The hypervisor inspects the page fault and discovers that the hypervisor moved the data to the paging space device, thereby causing the page fault. Processing continues with step .  (If the operating system that runs in the shared memory partition moved the data to auxiliary storage, thereby causing the page fault, then the operating system must retrieve the data.) The hypervisor sends a request to a paging VIOS partition to retrieve the data from the paging space device and to write it to the shared memory pool. The paging VIOS partition searches the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition and finds the data. The paging VIOS partition writes the data to the shared memory pool. The paging VIOS partition notifies the hypervisor that the data is in the shared memory pool. The hypervisor notifies the operating system that it can access the data. The operating system accesses the data in the shared memory pool. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Logical memory Logical memory is the address space, assigned to a logical partition, that the operating system perceives as its main storage. For a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition), a subset of the logical memory is backed up by physical main storage and the remaining logical memory is kept in auxiliary storage. You can configure minimum, maximum, desired, and assigned logical memory sizes for a shared memory partition.  Logical memory size Description Minimum The minimum amount of logical memory with which you want the shared memory partition to operate. You can dynamically remove logical memory from the shared memory partition down to this value. Maximum The maximum amount of logical memory that the shared memory partition is allowed to use. You can dynamically add logical memory to the shared memory partition up to this value. Desired The amount of logical memory with which you want the shared memory partition to activate. Assigned The amount of logical memory that the shared memory partition can use. A shared memory partition does not have to use all of its assigned logical memory at any given time. On systems that are managed by a  (), you configure the minimum, maximum, and desired logical memory sizes in the partition profile. When you activate the shared memory partition, the  assigns the desired logical memory to the shared memory partition.  On systems that are managed by the  (IVM), you configure the minimum, maximum, and desired logical memory sizes in the partition properties. When you create the shared memory partition, the IVM assigns the desired logical memory to the shared memory partition.  The following figure shows a shared memory partition with its logical memory.  You can change the assigned logical memory by dynamically adding or removing logical memory to or from the shared memory partition. You can dynamically add logical memory to the shared memory partition up to the maximum logical memory size, and you can dynamically remove logical memory from the shared memory partition down to its minimum logical memory size. If the shared memory pool is physically overcommitted, the hypervisor stores 0.2 GB of the shared memory partition's memory in a paging space device. When the shared memory partition needs to access the data that resides in the paging space device, the hypervisor retrieves the data for the operating system. The amount of physical memory allocated to the shared memory partition can be less than the minimum logical memory size. This is because the minimum logical memory size is a boundary for logical memory, not for physical memory. In addition to the minimum logical memory size, the maximum, desired, and assigned logical memory sizes also do not control the amount of physical memory assigned to the shared memory partition. Likewise, dynamically adding or removing logical memory to or from a shared memory partition does not change the amount of physical memory allocated to the shared memory partition. When you set the logical memory sizes and dynamically add or remove logical memory, you set or change the amount of memory that the operating system can use, and the hypervisor decides how to distribute that memory between the shared memory pool and the paging space device.

 Shared memory distribution The hypervisor uses the memory weight of each logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) to help determine which logical partitions receive more physical memory from the shared memory pool. To help optimize performance and memory use, the operating systems that run in shared memory partitions provide the hypervisor with information about how the operating system uses its memory to help the hypervisor determine which pages to store in the shared memory pool and which pages to store in the paging space devices. In a shared memory configuration that is physically overcommitted (where the sum of the logical memory that is currently used by of all shared memory partitions is greater than the amount of memory in the shared memory pool), the hypervisor stores a portion of the logical memory in the shared memory pool and stores the remainder of the logical memory in the paging space devices. The hypervisor determines the amount of physical memory to allocate from the shared memory pool to each shared memory partition and the amount of logical memory to store in the paging space devices. The hypervisor also determines which pieces, or pages, of memory to store in each location.  The smallest amount of physical memory that the hypervisor can allocate from the shared memory pool to a shared memory partition at any given time is the amount of physical memory that the shared memory partition requires for its I/O devices. The hypervisor guarantees to each shared memory partition that the shared memory partition can use a portion of the shared memory pool for its I/O devices, up to the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition. The largest amount of physical memory that the hypervisor can allocate from the shared memory pool to a shared memory partition at any given time is the amount of logical memory assigned to the shared memory partition. The amount of physical memory from the shared memory pool that the hypervisor allocates to the shared memory partitions is determined by the workloads that are running in the shared memory partitions and the amount of logical memory that is assigned to each shared memory partition. You can influence how much physical memory the hypervisor allocates from the shared memory pool to each shared memory partition by specifying a memory weight for each shared memory partition. Memory weight is a relative value that is one of the factors that the hypervisor uses to allocate physical memory from the shared memory pool to the shared memory partitions. A higher memory weight relative to the memory weights of other shared memory partitions increases the probability that the hypervisor allocates more physical memory to a shared memory partition.  To help maintain the best possible performance, the operating system that runs in a shared memory partition continually attempts to operate within the amount of physical memory allocated to it from the shared memory pool by moving its overcommitted logical memory to a paging space. In general, the operating system moves its memory to a paging space more often when it runs in a shared memory partition than when it runs in a dedicated memory partition. Therefore, the paging space that the operating system uses to manage its memory needs to be larger when the logical partition uses shared memory than when the logical partition uses dedicated memory. The operating systems that run in shared memory partitions provide information to the hypervisor about how the operating system uses its pages. When the hypervisor manages the overcommitted logical memory, it uses this information to determine which pages to store in the paging space device and which pages to store in the shared memory pool. When the hypervisor needs to deallocate physical memory from the shared memory partition and move it to the paging space device, the hypervisor requests the operating system to release pages. The operating system might mark the pages that it will not use, and the hypervisor moves the marked pages first. This enables the hypervisor to select the most optimal pages to move out of the shared memory pool, which improves memory use and performance. For example, the operating system uses one page for kernel data and another page for cache and the hypervisor needs to move one page to the paging space device. The hypervisor moves the cache page to the paging space device to optimize performance.  Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks: Related information:         
 Changing the memory weight of a shared memory partition You can use the  () to change the memory weight of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition). Changing the memory weight changes the probability that the shared memory partition receives physical memory from the shared memory pool in relation to other shared memory partitions. A  shared memory partition supports changing the memory weight only if the DynamicRM tool package is installed on the  shared memory partition. To download the DynamicRM tool package, see the  Web site. To change the memory weight assigned to the shared memory partition, complete the following steps from the :  The Add/Remove Memory Resources window is displayed. Changing the memory weight of a shared memory partition is temporary and is not reflected in the partition profile. The new memory weight that you assigned to the shared memory partition will be lost the next time you activate the partition profile. If you want to save the changes that you made to the memory weight of the shared memory partition, either change the partition profile or save the logical partition configuration to a new partition profile.

 Managing memory properties for shared memory partitions You can use the  to manage memory attributes for logical partitions that use shared memory. For logical partitions that use shared memory, you can use the  to manage some additional memory properties that apply to these partitions.  You can change the memory weight for the shared memory partition. The memory weight is a relative value that is one of the factors that the hypervisor uses in determining the allocation of physical system memory from the shared memory pool to a shared memory partition. A higher value relative to the values set for other shared memory partitions increases the probability of the hypervisor allocating more physical system memory from the memory pool to the shared memory partition with the higher value.  A  shared memory partition supports changing the memory weight only if the DynamicRM tool package is installed on the  shared memory partition. To download the DynamicRM tool package, see the  Web site. You also can change the memory mode for the partition from shared memory mode to dedicated memory mode or from dedicated mode to shared mode. To be able to change the memory mode from shared to dedicated for a logical partition, you must have enough physical system memory available to fulfill the current Assigned memory value and the partition must be shut down. To be able to change the memory mode from dedicated to shared for a client logical partition, the partition must use shared processors and cannot have any I/O devices or Integrated Virtual Ethernet (IVE) adapters (also known as Host Ethernet Adapters) assigned to it. The partition must be virtual. The logical partition also must be shut down.   You cannot use the  to change the I/O entitled memory, which is the amount of memory from the shared memory pool that the partition is entitled to use for I/O mapping purposes. The  manages this property for a partition that is based on the virtual I/O configuration of the partition unless you use the IVM command line interface (CLI) to define this property. To change the memory weight or the memory mode for a shared memory partition, complete these steps in the :  The View/Modify Partitions page is displayed.  The Partition Properties page is displayed.  The pending memory weight value must be greater than, or equal to, 0 but less than, or equal to, 255. Set this value relative to other shared memory partitions to rank the importance of having more physical memory from the shared memory pool available for this partition.   The management partition synchronizes the current assigned value with the pending assigned value. Synchronization can take several seconds to complete. You can perform other tasks on the system while the management partition is synchronizing the current and pending values.  Parent topic:  Related tasks: Related information:    |

 Adding a client logical partition to the partition workload group You can use a workload management tool to manage resources that your logical partitions use. To do so, you must use the  to add the client logical partition to the partition workload group. A partition workload group identifies a set of logical partitions that are located on the same physical system. Workload management tools use partition workload groups to identify which logical partitions they can manage. For example, Enterprise Workload Managerâ¢ (EWLM) can dynamically and automatically redistribute processing capacity within a partition workload group to satisfy workload performance goals. EWLM adjusts processing capacity based on calculations that compare the actual performance of work processed by the partition workload group to the business goals defined for the work. Workload management tools use dynamic logical partitioning (DLPAR) to make resource adjustments based on performance goals. For example, the partition management function of EWLM adjusts processor resources based on workload performance goals. Thus, EWLM can adjust the processing capacity for  logical partitions.  Do not add the management partition to the partition workload group. To manage logical partition resources, workload management tools often require that you install some type of management or agent software on the logical partitions. To avoid creating an unsupported environment, do not install additional software on the management partition. For    partitions, the DLPAR support of the operating system is not the same as the DLPAR capabilities that are in the partition properties for a logical partition.

 Limitations and restrictions of the  configuration Learn about  () configuration limitations. Consider the following when implementing virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI):  Virtual SCSI supports the following connection standards for backing devices: Fibre Channel, SCSI, SCSI RAID, iSCSI, SAS, SATA, USB, and IDE. The SCSI protocol defines mandatory and optional commands. While virtual SCSI supports all of the mandatory commands, not all of the optional commands are supported. There may be utilization implications when using virtual SCSI devices. Because the client/server model is made up of layers of function, using virtual SCSI can consume additional processor cycles when processing I/O requests. The  is a dedicated logical partition, to be used only for  operations. Other applications cannot run in the  logical partition.  If there is a resource shortage, performance degradation might occur. If a  is serving many resources to other logical partitions, ensure that enough processor power is available. In case of high workload across virtual Ethernet adapters and virtual disks, logical partitions might experience delays in accessing resources. Logical volumes and files exported as virtual SCSI disks are always configured as single path devices on the client logical partition.  Logical volumes or files exported as virtual SCSI disks that are part of the root volume group (rootvg) are not persistent if you reinstall the . However, they are persistent if you update the  to a new service pack.  Therefore, before reinstalling the , ensure that you back up the corresponding clients' virtual disks. When exporting logical volumes, it is best to export logical volumes from a volume group other than the root volume group. When exporting files, it is best to create file storage pools and the virtual media repository in a parent storage pool other than the root volume group. Consider the following when implementing virtual adapters: Only Ethernet adapters can be shared. Other types of network adapters cannot be shared. IP forwarding is not supported on the . The maximum number of virtual adapters can be any value from 2 to 65,536.  However, if you set the maximum number of virtual adapters to a value higher than 2048, the logical partition might fail to activate or the server firmware might require more system memory to manage the virtual adapters.

 Virtual SCSI latency Find information about virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) latency. I/O latency is the amount of time that passes between the initiation and completion of a disk I/O operation. For example, consider a program that performs 1000 random disk I/O operations, one at a time. If the time to complete an average operation is 6 milliseconds, the program runs in no fewer than 6 seconds. However, if the average response time is reduced to 3 milliseconds, the run time might be reduced by 3 seconds. Applications that are multithreaded or use asynchronous I/O might be less sensitive to latency, but in most circumstances, lesser latency can help improve performance. Because virtual SCSI is implemented as a client and server model, there is some  that does not exist with directly attached storage. The  might range from 0.03 to 0.06 milliseconds per I/O operation depending primarily on the block size of the request. The average  is comparable for both physical disk and logical volume-backed virtual drives. The latency experienced when using a  in a shared-processor logical partition can be higher and more variable than using a  in a dedicated logical partition. For additional information about the performance differences between dedicated logical partitions and shared-processor logical partitions, see . The following table identifies  for different block-size transmissions on both physical disk and logical-volume-backed virtual SCSI disks. Backing type 4 K 8 K 32 K 64 K 128 K Physical disk 0.032 0.033 0.033 0.040 0.061 Logical volume 0.035 0.036 0.034 0.040 0.063 The average disk-response time increases as the block size increases. The latency increases for a virtual SCSI operation are relatively greater on smaller block sizes because of their shorter response time. Parent topic:          
 Virtual SCSI sizing considerations Understand the processor and memory-sizing considerations when implementing virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI). When you are designing and implementing a virtual SCSI application environment, consider the following sizing issues: The amount of memory allocated to the  The processor entitlement of the  Whether the  is run as a shared-processor logical partition or as a dedicated processor logical partition The maximum transfer size limitation for physical devices The processor impacts of using virtual I/O on the client are insignificant. The processor cycles run on the client to perform a virtual SCSI I/O operation are comparable to that of a locally attached I/O device.  Thus, there is no increase or decrease in sizing on the client logical partition for a known task.  These sizing techniques do not anticipate combining the function of shared Ethernet with the virtual SCSI server.  If the two are combined, consider adding resources to account for the shared Ethernet activity with virtual SCSI. Virtual SCSI sizing using dedicated processor logical partitionsThe amount of processor entitlement required for a virtual SCSI server is based on the maximum I/O rates required of it. Because virtual SCSI servers do not normally run at maximum I/O rates all of the time, the use of surplus processor time is potentially wasted when using dedicated processor logical partitions. In the first of the following sizing methodologies, you need a good understanding of the I/O rates and I/O sizes required of the virtual SCSI server.  In the second, size the virtual SCSI server based on the I/O configuration. The sizing methodology used is based on the observation that the processor time required to perform an I/O operating on the virtual SCSI server is fairly constant for a given I/O size. It is a simplification to make this statement, because different device drivers have subtly varying efficiencies. However, under most circumstances, the I/O devices supported by the virtual SCSI server are sufficiently similar. The following table shows approximate cycles per second for both physical disk and logical volume operations on a 1.65 Ghz processor. These numbers are measured at the physical processor;  (SMT) operation is assumed.  For other frequencies, scaling by the ratio of the frequencies (for example, 1.5 Ghz = 1.65 Ghz / 1.5 Ghz Ã cycles per operation) is sufficiently accurate to produce a reasonable sizing. Disk type 4 KB 8 KB 32 KB 64 KB 128 KB Physical disk 45,000 47,000 58,000 81,000 120,000 Logical volume 49,000 51,000 59,000 74,000 105,000 Consider a  that uses three client logical partitions on physical disk-backed storage. The first client logical partition requires a maximum of 7,000 8-KB operations per second. The second client logical partition requires a maximum of 10,000 8-KB operations per second. The third client logical partition requires a maximum of 5,000 128-KB operations per second.  The number of 1.65 Ghz processors for this requirement is approximately ((7,000 Ã 47,000 + 10,000 Ã 47,000 + 5,000 Ã 120,000) / 1,650,000,000) = 0.85 processors, which rounds up to a single processor when using a dedicated processor logical partition. If the I/O rates of the client logical partitions are not known, you can size the  to the maximum I/O rate of the storage subsystem attached. The sizing could be biased toward small I/O operations or large I/O operations. Sizing to maximum capacity for large I/O operations will balance the processor capacity of the  to the potential I/O bandwidth of the attached I/O. The negative aspect of this sizing methodology is that, in nearly every case, more processor entitlement will be assigned to the  than it will typically consume. Consider a case in which a  manages 32 physical SCSI disks. A maximum limit of processors required can be established based on assumptions about the I/O rates that the disks can achieve. If it is known that the workload is dominated by 8096-byte operations that are random, then assume that each disk is capable of approximately 200 disk I/O operations per second (15k rpm drives). At peak, the  would need to serve approximately 32 disks Ã 200 I/O operations per second Ã  cycles per operation, resulting in a requirement for approximately 0.19 processor performance.  Viewed another way, a  running on a single processor should be capable of supporting more than 150 disks doing 8096-byte random I/O operations. Alternatively, if the  is sized for maximum bandwidth, the calculation results in a higher processor requirement. The difference is that maximum bandwidth assumes sequential I/O. Because disks are more efficient when they are performing large, sequential I/O operations than they are when performing small, random I/O operations, a higher number of I/O operations per second can be performed. Assume that the disks are capable of 50 MB per second when doing 128 KB I/O operations. That situation implies each disk could average 390 disk I/O operations per second. Thus, the amount of processing power necessary to support 32 disks, each doing 390 I/O operations per second with an operation cost of 120,000 cycles (32 Ã 390 Ã 120,000 / 1,650,000,000) results in approximately 0.91 processors. Consequently, a  running on a single processor should be capable of driving approximately 32 fast disks to maximum throughput. Virtual SCSI server sizing using shared processor logical partitionsDefining virtual SCSI servers in shared processor logical partitions allows more specific processor resource sizing and potential recovery of unused processor time by uncapped logical partitions. However, using shared-processor logical partitions for virtual SCSI servers can frequently increase I/O response time and make for somewhat more complex processor entitlement sizings. The sizing methodology should be based on the same operation costs for dedicated logical partition I/O servers, with added entitlement for running in shared-processor logical partitions. Configure the  as uncapped, so that, if the  is undersized, there is opportunity to get more processor time to serve I/O operations. Because I/O latency with virtual SCSI can vary due to a number of conditions, consider the following if a logical partition has high I/O requirements: Configure the logical partition with physical I/O if the configuration allows.  In most cases, the  logical partition can use a shared, uncapped processor. Virtual SCSI server memory sizingMemory sizing in virtual SCSI is simplified because there is no caching of file data in the memory of the virtual SCSI server. Because there is no data caching, the memory requirements for the virtual SCSI server are fairly modest. With large I/O configurations and very high data rates, a 1 GB memory allocation for the virtual SCSI server is likely to be sufficient.  For low I/O rate situations with a small number of attached disks, 512 MB will most likely suffice. Virtual SCSI maximum transfer size limitationIf you add another virtual target device to the virtual SCSI server adapter and the new virtual target device has a smaller maximum transfer size than the other configured devices on that adapter, the  does not show a new virtual device to the client.

 Virtual SCSI bandwidth View information about virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) bandwidth. I/O bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be read or written to a storage device in a unit of time. Bandwidth can be measured from a single thread or from a set of threads running concurrently. Although many customer applications are more sensitive to latency than bandwidth, bandwidth is crucial for many typical operations, such as backing up and restoring persistent data. The following table compares the results of bandwidth tests for virtual SCSI and physical I/O performance. In the tests, a single thread operates sequentially on a constant file that is 256 MB in size with a  running in a dedicated partition. More I/O operations are issued when reading or writing to the file using a small block size as compared to a larger block size. The test was conducted using a storage server with feature code 6239 (type 5704/0625) and a 2-gigabit Fibre Channel adapter attached to one RAID0 LUN that is composed of  5 physical disks from a DS4400 disk system (formerly a FAStT700). The table shows the comparison of measured bandwidth in megabytes per second (MB/s) using virtual SCSI and local attachment for reads with varying block sizes of operations. The difference between virtual I/O and physical I/O in these tests is attributable to the increased latency when using virtual I/O. Because of the larger number of operations, the bandwidth measured with small block sizes is lesser than with large block sizes.

Sizing the  for the  involves the following factors: Defining the target bandwidth (MB per second), or transaction rate requirements (operations per second). The target performance of the configuration must be determined from your workload requirements. Defining the type of workload (streaming or transaction oriented). Identifying the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size that will be used (1500 or jumbo frames). Determining if the  will run in a threaded or nonthreaded environment. Knowing the throughput rates that various Ethernet adapters can provide (see Adapter selection). Knowing the processor cycles required per byte of throughput or per transaction (see Processor allocation). Bandwidth requirementThe primary consideration is determining the target bandwidth on the physical Ethernet adapter of the . This will determine the rate that data can be transferred between the  and the client logical partitions. After the target rate is known, the correct type and number of network adapters can be selected. For example, Ethernet adapters of various speeds could be used. One or more adapters could be used on individual networks, or they could be combined using . Workload typeThe type of workload to be performed must be considered, whether it is streaming of data for workloads such as file transfer, data backup, or small transaction workloads, such as remote procedure calls. The streaming workload consists of large, full-sized network packets and associated small, TCP acknowledgment packets. Transaction workloads typically involve smaller packets or might involve small requests, such as a URL, and a larger response, such as a Web page. A  will need to frequently support streaming and small packet I/O during various periods of time. In that case, approach the sizing from both models. MTU sizeThe MTU size of the network adapters must also be considered. The standard Ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes. Gigabit Ethernet and 10 gigabit Ethernet can support 9000-byte MTU jumbo frames. Jumbo frames might reduce the processor cycles for the streaming types of workloads. However, for small workloads, the larger MTU size might not help reduce processor cycles. Threaded or nonthreaded environmentUse threaded mode when virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) will be run on the same  logical partition as . Threaded mode helps ensure that virtual SCSI and the  can share the processor resource appropriately. However, threading increases instruction-path length, which uses additional processor cycles. If the  logical partition will be dedicated to running shared Ethernet devices (and associated virtual Ethernet devices) only, the adapters should be configured with threading disabled. For more information, see . Adapter throughputKnowing the throughput capability of different Ethernet adapters can help you determine which adapters to use as Shared Ethernet Adapters and how many adapters to use. For more information, see . Processor entitlementYou must determine how much processor power is required to move data through the adapters at the desired rate. Networking device drivers are typically processor-intensive. Small packets can come in at a faster rate and use more processor cycles than larger packet workloads. Larger packet workloads are typically limited by network wire bandwidth and come in at a slower rate, thus requiring less processor power than small packet workloads for the amount of data transferred.

 Processor allocation This section contains processor-allocation guidelines for both dedicated processor logical partitions and shared processor logical partitions. Because Ethernet running MTU size of 1500 bytes consumes more processor cycles than Ethernet running Jumbo frames (MTU 9000),  the guidelines are different for each situation. In general, the processor utilization for large packet workloads on jumbo frames is approximately half that required for MTU 1500. If MTU is set to 1500, provide one processor (1.65 Ghz) per Gigabit Ethernet adapter to help reach maximum bandwidth. This equals ten 100-Mb Ethernet adapters if you are using smaller networks. For smaller transaction workloads, plan to use one full processor to drive the Gigabit Ethernet workload to maximum throughput. For example, if two Gigabit Ethernet adapters will be used, allocate up to two processors to the logical partition. If MTU is set to 9000 (jumbo frames), provide 50% of one processor (1.65 Ghz) per Gigabit Ethernet adapter to reach maximum bandwidth. Small packet workloads should plan to use one full processor to drive the Gigabit Ethernet workload. Jumbo frames have no effect on the small packet workload case.  using a dedicated processor logical partitionThe sizing provided is divided into two workload types: TCP streaming and TCP request and response. Both MTU 1500 and MTU 9000 networks were used in the sizing, which is provided in terms of machine cycles per byte of throughput for streaming or per transaction for request/response workloads. The data in the following tables was derived using the following formula: (number of processors Ã  processor_utilization Ã processor clock frequency) / Throughput rate in bytes per second or transaction per second = cycles per Byte or transaction. For the purposes of this test, the numbers were measured on a logical partition with one 1.65 Ghz processor with simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) enabled. For other processor frequencies, the numbers in these tables can be scaled by the ratio of the processor frequencies for approximate values to be used for sizing. For example, for a 1.5 Ghz processor speed, use 1.65/1.5 Ã cycles per byte value from the table. This example would result in a value of 1.1 times the value in the table, thus requiring 10% more cycles to adjust for the 10% slower clock rate of the 1.5 Ghz processor. To use these values, multiply your required throughput rate (in bytes or transactions) by the cycles per byte value in the following tables. This result will give you the required machine cycles for the workload for a 1.65 Ghz speed. Then adjust this value by the ratio of the actual machine speed to this 1.65 Ghz speed. To find the number of processors, divide the result by 1,650,000,000 cycles (or the cycles rate if you adjusted to a different speed machine). You would need the resulting number of processors to drive the workload. For example, if the  must deliver 200 MB of streaming throughput,  the following formula would be used:  200 Ã 1024 Ã 1024 Ã 11.2 = 2,348,810,240 cycles / 1,650,000,000 cycles per processor = 1.42 processors.  In round numbers, it would require 1.5 processors in the  to handle this workload.  The following tables show the machine cycles per byte for a TCP-streaming workload. Type of Streaming MTU 1500 rate and processor utilization MTU 1500, cycles per byte MTU 9000 rate and processor utilization MTU 9000, cycles per byte Simplex 112.8 MB at 80.6% processor 11.2 117.8 MB at 37.7% processor 5 Duplex 162.2 MB at 88.8% processor 8.6 217 MB at 52.5% processor 3.8 Type of Streaming MTU 1500 rate and processor utilization MTU 1500, cycles per byte MTU 9000 rate and processor utilization MTU 9000, cycles per byte Simplex 112.8 MB at 66.4% processor 9.3 117.8 MB at 26.7% processor 3.6 Duplex 161.6 MB at 76.4% processor 7.4 216.8 MB at 39.6% processor 2.9 The following tables show the machine cycles per transaction for a request and response workload. A transaction is defined as a round-trip request and reply size. Size of transaction Transactions per second and  utilization MTU 1500 or 9000, cycles per transaction Small packets (64 bytes) 59,722 TPS at 83.4% processor 23,022 Large packets (1024 bytes) 51,956 TPS at 80% processor 25,406 Size of transaction Transactions per second and  utilization MTU 1500 or 9000, cycles per transaction Small packets (64 bytes) 60,249 TPS at 65.6% processor 17,956 Large packets (1024 bytes) 53,104 TPS at 65% processor 20,196  At higher workload rates, like full duplex or the request and response workloads, the threads can run longer without waiting and being redispatched. Disable the thread option if the shared Ethernet is running in a  logical partition by itself (without virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) in the same logical partition). You can enable or disable threading using the  option of the  command. To enable threading, use the -attr thread=1 option. To disable threading, use the -attr thread=0 option. For example, the following command disables threading for  ent1:  mkvdev -sea ent1 -vadapter ent5 -default ent5 -defaultid 1 -attr thread=0 Sizing a  for shared Ethernet on a shared processor logical partitionCreating a shared-processor logical partition for a  can be done if the  is running slower-speed networks (for example 10/100 Mb) and a full processor logical partition is not needed. It is recommended that this be done only if the  workload is less than half a processor or if the workload is inconsistent. Configuring the  logical partition as uncapped might also allow it to use more processor cycles as needed to handle inconsistent throughput. For example, if the network is used only when other processors are idle, the  logical partition might be able to use other machine cycles and could be created with minimal processor to handle light workload during the day but the uncapped processor could use more machine cycles at night. If you are creating a  in a shared-processor logical partition, add additional entitled processors as a sizing contingency. Parent topic:          
 Adapter selection Use this section to find the attributes and performance characteristics of various types of Ethernet adapters to help you select which adapters to use in your environment. This section provides approximate throughput rates for various Ethernet adapters set at various MTU sizes. Use this information to determine which adapters will be needed to configure a . To make this determination, you must know the desired throughput rate of the client logical partitions. Following are general guidelines for network throughput. These numbers are not specific, but they can serve as a general guideline for sizing. In the following tables, the 100 MB, 1 GB, and 10 GB speeds are rounded down for estimating. Adapter speed Approximate throughput rate 10 Mb Ethernet 1 MB/second 100 Mb Ethernet 10 MB/second 1000 Mb Ethernet  (GB Ethernet) 100 MB/second 10000 Mb Ethernet (10 GB Ethernet,  or Integrated Virtual Ethernet) 1000 MB/second Adapter speed Approximate throughput rate 10 Mb Ethernet 2 MB/second 100 Mb Ethernet 20 MB/second 1000 Mb Ethernet  (Gb Ethernet) 150 MB/second 10000 Mb Ethernet (10 Gb Ethernet,  or Integrated Virtual Ethernet) 1500 MB/second The following tables list maximum network payload speeds, which are user payload data rates that can be obtained by sockets-based programs for applications that are streaming data. The rates are a result of the network bit rate, MTU size, physical level overhead , data link headers, and TCP/IP headers. A gigahertz-speed processor is assumed. These numbers are optimal for a single LAN. If your network traffic is going through additional network devices, your results might vary. In the following tables, raw bit rate is the physical media bit rate and does not reflect interframe gaps, preamble bits, data link headers, and trailers. Interframe gaps, preamble bits, data link headers, and trailers can all reduce the effective usable bit rate of the wire. Single direction (simplex) TCP streaming rates are rates that can be achieved by sending data from one machine to another in a memory-to-memory test. Full-duplex media can usually perform slightly better than half-duplex media because the TCP acknowledgment packets can flow without contending for the same wire that the data packets are flowing on. Network type Raw bit rate (Mb) Payload rate (Mb) Payload rate (MB) 10 Mb Ethernet, Half Duplex 10 6 0.7 10 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex 10 (20 Mb full duplex) 9.48 1.13 100 Mb Ethernet, Half Duplex 100 62 7.3 100 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex 100 (200 Mb full duplex) 94.8 11.3 1000 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex, MTU 1500 1000 (2000 Mb full duplex) 948 113 1000 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex, MTU 9000 1000 (2000 Mb full duplex) 989 117.9 10000 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex,  (or Integrated Virtual Ethernet) MTU 1500 10000 9479 1130 10000 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex,  (or Integrated Virtual Ethernet) MTU 9000 10000 9899 1180 Full-duplex TCP streaming workloads have data streaming in both directions. Workloads that can send and receive packets concurrently can take advantage of full duplex media. Some media, for example Ethernet in half-duplex mode, cannot send and receive concurrently, thus they will not perform any better, and can usually degrade performance, when running duplex workloads. Duplex workloads will not increase at a full doubling of the rate of a simplex workload because the TCP acknowledgment packets returning from the receiver must now compete with data packets flowing in the same direction. Network type Raw bit rate (Mb) Payload rate (Mb) Payload rate (MB) 10 Mb Ethernet, Half Duplex 10 5.8 0.7 10 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex 10 (20 Mb full duplex) 18 2.2 100 Mb Ethernet, Half Duplex 100 58 7 100 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex 100 (200 Mb full duplex) 177 21.1 1000 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex, MTU 1500 1000 (2000 Mb full duplex) 1470 (1660 peak) 175 (198 peak) 1000 Mb Ethernet, Full Duplex, MTU 9000 1000 (2000 Mb full duplex) 1680 (1938 peak) 200 (231 peak) 10000 Mb Ethernet,  (or Integrated Virtual Ethernet) Full Duplex, MTU 1500 10000 14680 (15099 peak) 1750 (1800 peak) 10000 Mb Ethernet,  (or Integrated Virtual Ethernet) Full Duplex, MTU 9000 10000 16777 (19293 pack) 2000 (2300 peak) Notes:Peak numbers represent optimal throughput with multiple TCP sessions running in each direction. Other rates are for a single TCP session. 1000 MB Ethernet (gigabit Ethernet) duplex rates are for the PCI-X adapter in PCI-X slots. Data rates are for TCP/IP using the IPv4 protocol. Adapters with MTU set to 9000 have RFC 1323 enabled.   Parent topic:          
 Memory allocation Find information about memory allocation and sizing. In general, 512 MB of memory per logical partition is sufficient for most configurations. Enough memory must be allocated for the  data structures. Ethernet adapters and virtual devices use dedicated receive buffers. These buffers are used to store the incoming packets, which are then sent over the outgoing device.  A physical Ethernet adapter typically uses 4 MB for MTU 1500 or 16 MB for MTU 9000 for dedicated receive buffers for gigabit Ethernet. Other Ethernet adapters are similar. Virtual Ethernet, typically uses 6 MB for dedicated receive buffers. However, this number can vary based on workload. Each instance of a physical or virtual Ethernet would need memory for this number of buffers. In addition, the system has an mbuf buffer pool per processor that is used if additional buffers are needed.  These mbufs typically occupy 40 MB. Parent topic:          
 Security considerations Review the security considerations for virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI), virtual Ethernet, and  and the additional security options available.   allow cross-partition device sharing and communication. Functions such as dynamic LPAR, shared processors, virtual networking, virtual storage, and workload management all require facilities to ensure that system-security requirements are met. Cross-partition and virtualization features are designed to not introduce any security exposure beyond what is implied by the function. For example, a virtual LAN connection would have the same security considerations as a physical network connection. Carefully consider how to utilize cross-partition virtualization features in high-security environments. Any visibility between logical partitions must be manually created through administrative system-configuration choices.  However, instead of SCSI or fiber cable, the connection for this functionality is done by the firmware. The virtual SCSI device drivers of the  and the firmware ensure that only the system administrator of the  has control over which logical partitions can access data on  storage devices. For example, a client logical partition that has access to a logical volume lv001 exported by the  logical partition cannot access lv002, even if it is in the same volume group.  Similar to virtual SCSI, the firmware also provides the connection between logical partitions when using virtual Ethernet. The firmware provides the Ethernet switch functionality. The connection to the external network is provided by the  function on the . This part of the  acts as a layer-2 bridge to the physical adapters. A VLAN ID tag is inserted into every Ethernet frame. The Ethernet switch restricts the frames to the ports that are authorized to receive frames with that VLAN ID. Every port on an Ethernet switch can be configured to be a member of several VLANs. Only the network adapters, both virtual and physical, that are connected to a port (virtual or physical) that belongs to the same VLAN can receive the frames. The implementation of this VLAN standard ensures that the logical partitions cannot access restricted data. Parent topic:

It can have up to 16 disk units (logical volumes, physical volumes, or files) and up to 16 optical units. The maximum virtual disk size is 2 TB minus 512 bytes. If you are limited to 1 adapter and you have a storage requirement of 32 TB, for example, you might need to make your virtual disks the maximum size of 2 TB. However, in general, consider spreading the storage over multiple virtual disks with smaller capacities. This can help improve concurrency. Mirroring and multipath through up to 8  partitions is the redundancy option for client logical partitions. However, you also can use multipathing and RAID on the  for redundancy. It is required that you assign the tape device to its own  adapter, as tape devices often send large amounts of data, which might affect the performance of any other device on the adapter. Virtual Fibre Channel limitations The  client partition supports up to 128 target port connections per virtual fibre channel adapter.  The  client partition supports up to 64 SCSI devices per virtual Fibre Channel adapter. The 64 SCSI devices can be any combination of disk units or tape libraries. With tape libraries, each control path is counted as a unique SCSI device in addition to a single SCSI device per tape drive.  For  client partitions, the LUNs of the physical storage connected with NPIV require a storage-specific device driver and do not use the generic virtual SCSI device driver.  The  client partition supports up to eight multipath connections to a single fibre channel disk unit. Each multipath connection can be made with a virtual Fibre Channel adapter or with Fibre Channel I/O adapter hardware that is assigned to the  partition. Each virtual Fibre Channel adapter in an  client partition must connect to a different physical Fibre Channel port. Connecting more than one virtual Fibre Channel adapter in the same client logical partition to a single physical Fibre Channel adapter port in the Virtual I/O Server is not supported.

General notes client logical partitions do not own any physical I/O resources. All I/O resources on the  client logical partition are virtual Ethernet and virtual storage  The  client logical partition has no view of the physical hardware. This affects how certain commands can operate, the amount of data returned by existing CL commands, APIs, and MI instructions, and how you can perform some  operations, such as servicing the logical partition. Hardware and software prerequisitesThe managed system must be one of the servers as follows:            For a complete overview and instructions for running  on a server, see the .

You cannot configure a local console directly attached to the server (with or without remote access allowed) and you cannot configure a remote console through dial-up support. You must configure virtual Ethernet bridging on the . You can perform main storage dumps in one of the following ways:You can write the data to virtual tape that is backed by a physical tape device. You can write the data to storage, copy it to virtual tape that is backed by files from the integrated file system, and then send it to IBM service and support by using FTP. You can write the data to virtual file-backed optical, transfer the data to physical tape, and then send the physical tape to IBM service and support. You can back up  in one of the following ways:You can write the data to virtual tape that is backed by files from the  integrated file system, and then send it to another system by using FTP. You can write the data to virtual tape that is backed by a physical tape device.  You can write the data to a file-backed virtual optical device in the management partition, and then save the data to physical tape by using the  command.   Backing up  to optical devices (including file-backed optical devices) is typically slower than backing up  to physical tape. Because the installation media for  is greater than 2 GB, you must use the command line to upload the  installation media to the management partition as follows:Open a virtual terminal session to the  command-line interface.   Run the following command:mkvopt -name MediaName -file FileName -ro  Where:MediaName is the name of the media that you plan to upload to the management partition. For example, v5r5m0drv250.002. FileName is the name of the file that you plan to upload to the management partition. For example, v5r5m0-drv250.002.iso.

Using the  command, you can set, change, and view current security settings. By default, no  security levels are set. You must run the  command to change the settings.  The following sections provide an overview of these features.  system security hardeningThe system security hardening feature protects all elements of a system by tightening security or implementing a higher level of security. Although hundreds of security configurations are possible with the  security settings, you can easily implement security controls by specifying a high, medium, or low security level. Using the system security hardening features provided by , you can specify values such as the following:Password policy settings Actions such as usrck, pwdck, grpck, and sysck Default file-creation settings Settings included in the  command Configuring a system at too high a security level might deny services that are needed. For example, telnet and rlogin are disabled for high level security because the login password is sent over the network unencrypted. If a system is configured at too low a security level, the system might be vulnerable to security threats. Since each enterprise has its own unique set of security requirements, the predefined High, Medium, and Low security configuration settings are best suited as a starting point for security configuration rather than an exact match for the security requirements of a particular enterprise. As you become more familiar with the security settings, you can make adjustments by choosing the hardening rules you want to apply. You can get information about the hardening rules by running the  command.  firewallUsing the  firewall, you can enforce limitations on IP activity in your virtual environment. With this feature, you can specify which ports and network services are allowed access to the  system. For example, if you need to restrict login activity from an unauthorized port, you can specify the port name or number and specify deny to remove it from the allow list. You can also restrict a specific IP address.  You can set up remote connections to the  using secure connections. Set the security level to specify security hardening rules for your  system. Enable the  firewall to control IP activity. You can configure a Kerberos client on the  to enhance security in communications across the Internet. With  Version 2.2, and later, a system administrator can define roles based on job functions in an organization by using role-based access control (RBAC). You can create, list, change, switch, and remove users by using . Parent topic:          
 Configuring  system security hardening Set the security level to specify security hardening rules for your  system. To implement system security hardening rules, you can use the  command to specify a security level of high, medium, or low. A default set of rules is defined for each level. You can also set a level of default, which returns the system to the system standard settings and removes any level settings that have been applied.  The low level security settings are a subset of the medium level security settings, which are a subset of the high level security settings. Therefore, the high level is the most restrictive and provides the greatest level of control. You can apply all of the rules for a specified level or select which rules to activate for your environment. By default, no  security levels are set; you must run the  command to modify the settings. Use the following tasks to configure the system security settings. Parent topic:  Setting a security level  For example:viosecure -level low -apply Changing the settings in a security level  For example:At the  command line, type viosecure -level high. All the security level options (hardening rules) at that level are displayed ten at a time (pressing Enter displays the next set in the sequence).  Review the options displayed and make your selection by entering the numbers, separated by a comma, that you want to apply, or type  to apply all the options or  to apply none of the options.  Press  to display the next set of options, and continue entering your selections. To exit the command without making any changes, type .  Viewing the current security setting  For example: viosecure -view Removing security level settings         
 Configuring  firewall settings Enable the  firewall to control IP activity. The  firewall is not enabled by default. To enable the  firewall, you must turn it on by using the  command with the  option. When you enable it, the default setting is activated, which allows access for the following IP services:ftp ftp-data ssh web https rmc cimom  The firewall settings are contained in the file viosecure.ctl in the  directory. If for some reason the viosecure.ctl file does not exist when you run the command to enable the firewall, you receive an error. You can use the  option to enable the standard firewall default ports. You can use the default setting or configure the firewall settings to meet the needs of your environment by specifying which ports or port services to allow. You can also turn off the firewall to deactivate the settings.  Use the following tasks at the  command line to configure the  firewall settings:  viosecure -firewall on  viosecure -firwall allow | deny -port number  viosecure -firewall view  viosecure -firewall off Parent topic:          
 Configuring a Kerberos client on the  You can configure a Kerberos client on the  to enhance security in communications across the Internet. Before you start, ensure that the  Version 1.5 or later.  Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that provides authentication for client and server applications by using a secret-key cyrptography. It negotiates authenticated, and optionally encrypted, communications between two points anywhere on the Internet. Kerberos authentication generally works as follows:  A Kerberos client sends a request for a ticket to the Key Distribution Center (KDC). The KDC creates a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for the client and encrypts it using the client's password as the key.  The KDC returns the encrypted TGT to the client. The client attempts to decrypt the TGT, using its password.  If the client successfully decrypts the TGT (for example, if the client gives the correct password), the client keeps the decrypted TGT. The TGT indicates proof of the client's identity.  mkkrb5clnt -c KDC_server -r realm_name \ -s Kerberos_server -d Kerberos_client Where:KDC_server is the name of the KDC server. realm_name is the name of the realm to which you want to configure the Kerberos client. Kerberos_server is the fully qualified host name of the Kerberos server. Kerberos_client is the domain name of the Kerberos client. For example:mkkrb5clnt -c bob.kerberso.com -r KERBER.COM \ -s bob.kerberso.com -d testbox.com In this example, you configure the Kerberos client, testbox.com, to the Kerberos server, bob.kerberso.com. The KDC is running on bob.kerberso.com. Parent topic:

 Changing the virtual SCSI queue depth Increasing the virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) queue depth might provide performance improvements for some virtual configurations. Understand the factors involved in determining a change to the virtual SCSI queue depth value. The virtual SCSI queue depth value determines how many requests the disk head driver will queue to the virtual SCSI client driver at any one time. Increasing this value might improve the throughput of the disk in specific configurations. However, several factors must be taken into consideration. These factors include the value of the queue-depth attribute for all of the physical storage devices on the  being used as a virtual target device by the disk instance on the client logical partition, and the maximum transfer size for the virtual SCSI client adapter instance that is the parent device for the disk instance. For  client logical partitions, the maximum transfer size for virtual SCSI client adapters is set by the , which determines the value based on the resources available on the server and the maximum transfer size set for the physical storage devices on that server. Other factors include the queue depth and maximum transfer size of other devices involved in mirrored-volume-group or Multipath I/O (MPIO) configurations. Increasing the queue depth for some devices might reduce the resources available for other devices on that same shared adapter and decrease the throughput for those devices.  To change the queue depth for an  client logical partition, on the client logical partition use the  command with the  attribute as in the following example:chdev -l hdiskN -a "queue_depth=value" hdiskN represents the name of a physical volume and value is the value you assign between 1 and 256. To change the queue depth for a  client logical partition on the client logical partition, use the  command as in the following example:echo 16 > /sys/devices/vio/30000003/host0/target0:0:1/0:0:1:0/queue_depth By default, the value of the  attribute for a disk on the  operating system is 16.   To view the current setting for the queue_depth value, from the client logical partition issue the following command:lsattr -El hdiskN Parent topic:

Data is transmitted to the  directly through the hypervisor. Thus, configured network connectivity is not required between the client logical partitions and the  on which the log files are stored. The  administrator can create and manage the log files by using the  command-line interface. The following table lists the commands that can be used to configure and manage the Trusted Logging capability. Command Description Changes the configuration of an existing virtual log. Changes the configuration of a virtual log repository. Lists the currently defined virtual logs. Lists the current configuration of the virtual log repositories. Creates a new virtual log. Removes an existing virtual log. The Trusted Logging capability introduces the following concepts:Virtual log repositories Virtual logs Virtual log devices These concepts are present in the  as illustrated in the following figure. The virtual log devices are attached to virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapters to expose the virtual log functions to client logical partitions. The virtual log devices are backed by virtual logs. Virtual logs are present in the  file system as subdirectories within the virtual log repository. The virtual log repository is a directory in the  file system. The following figure shows the concepts of the Trusted Logging capability. Virtual log repositories are directories in the file system accessible by the  (). You can create one or more virtual logs in a virtual log repository. A virtual log is a directory in a virtual log repository. A virtual log device is a virtual target device on the  (), attached to a virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) host adapter and backed by a virtual log.

You can use the Trusted Logging feature to direct log data to a file system shared across  () logical partitions.  Parent topic:  Related reference: Related information:         
 Virtual log repositories Virtual log repositories are directories in the file system accessible by the  (). You can create one or more virtual logs in a virtual log repository.  Every  has at least the local virtual log repository in the  directory by default. If the  is configured to use shared storage pools, there is another repository associated with each shared storage pool. When virtual logs are created, they are placed inside a specified virtual log repository. If an alternative repository is not specified, the local repository is used by default. The  administrator can change the location of the local repository in the file system. However, shared storage pool repositories must reside in a fixed location. Parent topic:          
 Virtual logs A virtual log is a directory in a virtual log repository. The virtual log is used to store logs that are generated by an  logical partition. The properties of a virtual log can either be specified or inherited from the virtual log repository when the virtual log is created. The following table lists the virtual log properties.Property Description Unique ID (UUID) Specifies the unique ID of the virtual log. This value is assigned when the virtual log is created and is retained permanently. If a logical partition is migrated to another system, the virtual log is re-created with the same configuration and unique ID on the destination  () partition. For more information, see . State Indicates whether the virtual log can be attached to a client logical partition. It has the following possible values: Enabled: Indicates that the virtual log can be attached to a client logical partition. Migrated: Indicates that the virtual log is active on another  after a migration operation. Disabled: Indicates that the virtual log is not available for use by a client logical partition. Client name Indicates the name of the client. This property can be set to any value. However, typically all virtual logs intended for a particular client logical partition are assigned the same client name, for ease of administration. If a virtual log is created and attached to a client logical partition in a single operation, the  attempts to obtain the host name from the client logical partition and use that as the client name if it is not specified on the command line. Log name Indicates the name of a virtual log. This property can be assigned any value by the administrator of the client logical partition, depending on the purpose, and must be provided when a new virtual log is created. For example, you can create two virtual logs, audit and syslog, for a given logical partition for the collection of audit and syslog data. Maximum log file size Specifies the maximum file size of the virtual log in bytes. Maximum number of log files Specifies the maximum number of virtual log files. Maximum state file size Specifies the maximum size of the state file in bytes. A state file consists of additional information about when the virtual log devices were configured, opened, closed, and various other operations that might be of interest in an analysis of log activity.  Maximum number of state files Specifies the maximum number of state files. A state file consists of additional information about when the virtual log devices were configured, opened, closed, and various other operations that might be of interest in an analysis of log activity.   The client name and log name properties also define the directory within the virtual log repository in which the log is stored. A virtual log repository contains a subdirectory for each client name. This subdirectory contains a directory for each log name. For example, with the local virtual log repository set to the default directory , a virtual log with the client name lpar-01 and the log name audit stores the logs in the  directory. If you rename the logical partition or change the host name, the client name property is not automatically updated. Use the  command to change the value of the client name for the virtual log. Each virtual log consists of the following types of information:Log data: Raw log data generated by the client logical partition. The log data is stored in files named in the client_name_log_name.nnn format. State data: Additional information about when the virtual log devices were configured, opened, closed, and various other operations that might be of interest in an analysis of log activity. This data is generated without any explicit user action. The state data is stored in files that are named in the client_name_log_name.state.nnn format. In both cases, nnn starts at 000. The data is written to that file until the next write operation increases the size of the file to a value more than the maximum log file size. When the size of the file increases to a value more than the maximum log file size, nnn is incremented and a new file is created, overwriting any existing file with that name. Log data is written to the new file until nnn is incremented again and it reaches the limit specified in the properties of the virtual log. At this stage, nnn is reset to 000. For example, consider a virtual log with the following properties:Client name:                    lpar-01 Log name:                       audit Maximum number of log files:    3 Maximum log file size:          2091216 Maximum number of state files:  2 Maximum state file size:        1000000 After a period of continued log generation, where the log files might have wrapped multiple times, the following directory contents are expected. The new log data are written to lpar-01_audit.002 and the new state data are written to lpar-01_audit.state.000. For example, running ls âl /var/vio/vlogs/lpar-01/audit results in the following output:-rw------- 1 root    system      2091216 May 25 18:28 lpar-01_audit.000 -rw------- 1 root    system      2091216 May 25 18:38 lpar-01_audit.001 -rw------- 1 root    system       752104 May 25 18:48 lpar-01_audit.002 -rw------- 1 root    system        16450 May 25 18:45 lpar-01_audit.state.000 -rw------- 1 root    system      1000000 May 21 07:23 lpar-01_audit.state.001 Parent topic:          
 Live Partition Mobility of virtual log devices When a client logical partition is moved from one host system to another during Live Partition Mobility, new virtual log devices are created on the destination  ().  these new virtual logs are independent of the virtual logs on the source . The configuration data of the source virtual log without the log file content is copied to the destination virtual log during migration. After migration, the source virtual log is placed in the migrated state to indicate that the virtual log is no longer active on the system and that it has been moved to another system. If you use a migration operation to move the client logical partition back to the original host system, and you select the original  to host the virtual logs of the logical partition, the existing virtual log is moved back to the enabled state.

 Benefits of using virtual log devices with shared storage pools Using virtual log devices with shared storage pools provides multipath logs on a single system and Live Partition Mobility of virtual logs. You can use the trusted log feature to direct log data to a file system shared across more than one  () and obtain a single view of logical partition activity across several separate systems. This feature provides the following benefits:Multipath logs on a single system: By using virtual logs in shared storage pools, more than one  on a single host can make the same virtual log available to a client logical partition through different virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) host adapters. The client logical partition detects the multipath arrangement and tolerates the deactivation of a single  by failing over to an alternative path, without losing log data. Live Partition Mobility of virtual logs: When  logical partitions on two different hosts have visibility of the same shared storage pool virtual log repository, a migration operation is able to continuously write to a single set of log files inside the shared storage pool, rather than to two different local virtual log repositories. Thus, in contrast to Live Partition Mobility with local virtual log repositories where the log files are split across two file systems, a single log file continues to be written across the migration operation.

 Using virtual log devices with shared storage pools Learn about using virtual log devices with shared storage pools. To use virtual logs with shared storage pools, the  logical partitions must be clustered together. For instructions, see . This process creates a shared storage pool, the name of which is used in virtual log commands to operate on virtual logs within that shared storage pool. To create a virtual log inside a shared storage pool, complete the following tasks:  For example, entering the mkvlog -sp spool1 -name syslog -client lpar-01 command returns results similar to the following:Virtual log f5dee41bf54660c2841c989811de41dd created  vtlog1 Available  The ,  and  commands operate on virtual logs in shared storage pools in the same way that they operate on virtual logs in the local virtual log repository. However, the  command cannot be used to change virtual logs that are currently connected to virtual log devices anywhere in the cluster. The virtual log devices must be removed before changes can be made to the virtual log configuration. Additionally, the root path to a shared storage pool virtual log repository cannot be changed. The location is decided by the mount point of the shared storage pool on the  ().  Each shared storage pool has a separate virtual log repository with a separate set of default properties that are inherited by virtual logs created within that virtual log repository. By default, the  command displays the properties of all virtual log repositories. You can use the  and  options to display the properties of a specific virtual log repository. Parent topic:          
 Creating a virtual log You can create a virtual log and attach it to a virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) host adapter by using the  command. To create a virtual log and attach it to a virtual SCSI (VSCSI) host adapter, complete the following tasks:  Virtual log 00000000000000005b3f6b7cfcec4c67 created This command creates the syslog virtual log with the lpar-01 client name and other properties inherited from the default values that are associated with the virtual log repository. The  command returns the UUID that has been assigned to the new virtual log.  mkvlog -uuid 00000000000000005b3f6b7cfcec4c67 -vadapter vhost0 Results similar to the following are displayed:vtlog0 Available You can also create a virtual log and attach it to a VSCSI host adapter by using a single command instead of using the commands specified in step  and . For example, entering the mkvlog -name audit -vadapter vhost1 command creates a new virtual log with the log name audit. This virtual log is attached to the VSCSI host adapter vhost1, with the client name set to the host name of the client logical partition that is attached to vhost1. Results similar to the following are displayed:Virtual log 0000000000000000d96e956aa842d5f4 created vtlog0 Available   If the client logical partition is running, the client name does not need to be specified because the  command discovers the client name from the client logical partition.

 Reconfiguring virtual logs or virtual log devices You can reconfigure virtual logs or virtual log devices by using the  command. To reconfigure virtual logs or virtual log devices, use the following commands, as applicable: To change the properties of a virtual log, enter the  command. You can change the properties of virtual logs even if the virtual log is attached to a virtual log device on a virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapter, and the changes are immediate. If the virtual log is connected to a virtual SCSI adapter, it can be specified by using the name of the virtual log device. For example, to change the log file size on the running virtual log device vtlog0 to 2 MB, enter the chvlog -dev vtlog0 -lfs 2M command. Results similar to the following are displayed:Updated device. Regardless of whether a virtual log is connected to a virtual SCSI adapter, a virtual log can always be specified by using the UUID of the virtual log. For example, to change the state of the virtual log with UUID 00000000000000003cee6408c885d677 to disabled, enter the chvlog -uuid 00000000000000003cee6408c885d677 -state disabled command. Results similar to the following are displayed.Updated device. The state property for a virtual log controls whether the virtual log can be connected to a virtual SCSI adapter. Therefore, it is not valid to change the state property when the virtual log is attached to a virtual log device. For example, to change the state of the virtual log with UUID 00000000000000003cee6408c885d677 to disabled when it is connected to a virtual SCSI host adapter, enter the chvlog -uuid 00000000000000003cee6408c885d677 -state disabled command. Results similar to the following are displayed:To change the state, the virtual log must not be connected to a device. If you enter the  command, the VTD column is blank for this virtual log. To delete the virtual log device while retaining the virtual log, use the  command. Parent topic:          
 Removing virtual logs or virtual log devices You can use the  command to remove virtual logs or virtual log devices from a virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapter, or to unconfigure a virtual log device. The virtual log can be specified by using the UUID or by the associated virtual log device name, if it exists. To remove virtual log devices or virtual logs, use the following commands, as applicable: To change the specified virtual log device from the Available state to the Defined state, enter the  command. To specify the virtual log device by name, use the  option. For example, entering rmvlog -dev vtlog0 returns results similar to the following:vtlog0 Defined To specify the virtual log device, use the  option. When you use this option, the virtual log device that is currently associated with a virtual log and the specified UUID is changed. For example, entering rmvlog -uuid 0000000000000000a3e4dd0ba75972c2 returns results similar to the following:vtlog0 Defined To remove the specified virtual log device, specify the  option in addition to either the  or  option. When you use the  option, the virtual log device is deleted. However, the virtual log and all associated properties and data are retained.  For example, entering the rmvlog -dev vtlog0 -d returns results similar to the following:vtlog0 deleted To remove the virtual log device and the virtual log, specify the  option. When you use this option, the data is still retained. For example, entering the rmvlog -uuid 9705340b31a7883573a1cd04b2254efd -db command returns results similar to the following:Virtual log 9705340b31a7883573a1cd04b2254efd deleted. To remove the virtual log device, the virtual log, and any log files that are associated with the virtual log, specify the  option. For example, entering the rmvlog -dev vtlog0 -dbdata command returns results similar to the following:vtlog1 deleted Virtual log 02392437473b6c552680a9ddd2fd8d06 deleted. Log files deleted.

 Getting started with Trusted Firewall Learn about using the Trusted Firewall feature that is supported on the PowerSC Editions. You can use this feature to perform intervirtual LAN routing functions by using the Security Virtual Machine (SVM) kernel extension.  With  () Version 2.2.1.4, or later, you can configure and manage the Trusted Firewall feature. By using this feature, logical partitions on different VLANs of the same server can communicate through the shared Ethernet adapter. The shared Ethernet adapter calls the intervirtual LAN routing functions through the SVM kernel extension. The SVM kernel extension consists of the following intervirtual LAN routing functions:Layer 3 routing: VLANs represent different logical networks. Therefore, a layer 3 router is required to connect the VLANs. Network filtering rules: Network filtering rules are required to permit, deny, or route intervirtual LAN network traffic. Network filtering rules can be configured by using the  command-line interface.   The following table lists the commands that can be used to configure and manage the Trusted Firewall feature by using the  command-line interface. Command Description Changes the definition of a VLAN-crossing filter rule in the filter rule table. Adds a filter rule for the VLAN-crossing between logical partitions on the same Power Systemsâ¢ server. Lists the VLAN-crossing filter rules and their status. Activates the VLAN-crossing filter rules defined by the  command. Removes the VLAN-crossing filter rules from the filter table. Displays or clears the IP and Media Access Control (MAC) mappings.

 Configuring a  with the  command-line interface To configure a shared Ethernet adapter (SEA) with  versions before 7, Release 3.4.2, you must use the  command-line interface. In SEA, quality of service (QoS) is provided per SEA thread. By default, SEA runs in thread mode with seven threads. When SEA receives traffic, it routes the traffic to a thread, based on source and destination information. If the QoS mode is enabled, it further queues the traffic, based on its priority, to the appropriate priority queue associated with the selected thread. Queued traffic for a particular thread is serviced in the order of higher to lower priority. All threads handle all priorities. SEA QoS does not assure bandwidth for a particular priority. The effect of SEA QoS can be seen when there is enough traffic to keep all SEA threads busy, such that when a SEA thread is scheduled to run, it has enough higher priority traffic to service before it can get to the lower priority traffic. SEA QoS is not effective when the traffic pattern is such that the higher and lower priority traffic is spread across different threads. Before you can configure an SEA, you must first create the virtual Ethernet trunk adapter by using the  ().   You can configure an SEA with the  command-line interface.  lsdev -virtual  lsdev -type adapter  Ensure that TCP/IP is not configured on the interface for the physical Ethernet adapter. If TCP/IP is configured, the  command in the next step fails. You can also use a  device as the SEA. If you plan to use the  or Integrated Virtual Ethernet with the SEA, ensure that you use the Logical Host Ethernet adapter to create the SEA.  mkvdev -sea target_device -vadapter virtual_ethernet_adapters \ -default DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter -defaultid SEADefaultPVID Where: DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter The default virtual Ethernet adapter used to handle untagged packets. If you have only one virtual Ethernet adapter for this logical partition, use it as the default. SEADefaultPVID The PVID associated with your default virtual Ethernet adapter. target_device The physical adapter that is being used as part of the SEA device. virtual_ethernet_adapters The comma-separated list of the virtual Ethernet adapters that are used as a part of the SEA device.  All virtual adapters in a Shared Ethernet Adapter must be members of the same virtual switch.  For example:To create an SEAent3 with ent0 as the physical Ethernet adapter (or ) and ent2 as the only virtual Ethernet adapter (defined with a PVID of 1), type the following command: mkvdev -sea ent0 -vadapter ent2 -default ent2 -defaultid 1 To obtain the value for the SEADefaultPVID attribute in the  command, type the following command:enstat -all ent2 | grep "Port VLAN ID:" Output similar to the following example is displayed:Port VLAN ID: 1  lsdev -virtual  Yes: Go to step . No: You are finished with this procedure and can skip the remaining steps.  Yes: Go to step  to enable the SEA device to prioritize traffic. No: Go to step  to configure a TCP/IP connection.  Yes: Go to step  to create VLAN pseudo-devices. No: Go to step  to configure a TCP/IP connection.   mkvdev -vlan TargetAdapter -tagid TagID Where: TargetAdapter is the SEA. TagID is the VLAN ID that you defined when you created the virtual Ethernet adapter associated with the SEA.  For example, to create a VLAN pseudo-device using the SEA ent3 that you created with a VLAN ID of 1, type the following command: mkvdev -vlan ent3 -tagid 1  lsdev -virtual  The first connection must be on the same VLAN and logical subnet as the default gateway.mktcpip -hostname Hostname -inetaddr Address -interface Interface -netmask \ SubnetMask -gateway Gateway -nsrvaddr NameServerAddress -nsrvdomain Domain Where: Hostname is the host name of the  Address is the IP address that you want to use for the TCP/IP connection Interface is the interface that is associated with either the SEA device or a VLAN pseudo-device. For example, if the SEA device is ent3, the associated interface is en3. Subnetmask is the subnet mask address for your subnet. Gateway is the gateway address for your subnet. NameServerAddress is the address of your domain name server. Domain is the name of your domain. If you do not have more VLANs, then you are finished with this procedure and can skip the remaining steps.  chdev -dev interface -perm -attr netaddr=IPaddress -attr netmask=netmask  -attr state=up When using this command, enter the interface (enX) associated with either the SEA device or VLAN pseudo-device.   Along with configuring QoS on the VLAN devices, you can configure the QoS priority for a virtual Ethernet adapter, by using the Management console as well. You can also configure VLANs on  logical partitions. For more information, see the documentation for the  operating system.  For more information about the modes, see SEA.  Packets that are sent over the default VLAN ID (specified in the  or  field) are not tagged as VLAN; therefore, a VLAN priority value cannot be assigned to them.  Traffic sent over the interface created in step 7 will be tagged as VLAN and its VLAN header will have the VLAN priority value specified in step 6. When this traffic is bridged by a SEA that has been enabled for bandwidth apportioning, the VLAN priority value is used to determine how quickly it should be sent in relation to other packets at different priorities.  The  is now configured. After you configure the TCP/IP connections for the virtual adapters on the client logical partitions using the client logical partitions' operating systems, those logical partitions can communicate with the external network.

  failover  failover provides redundancy by configuring a backup  on a different  logical partition that can be used if the primary  fails. The network connectivity in the client logical partitions continues without disruption. A  is comprised of a physical adapter (or several physical adapters grouped under a  device) and one or more virtual Ethernet adapters. It can provide layer 2 connectivity to multiple client logical partitions through the virtual Ethernet adapters. The  failover configuration uses the priority value that is given to the virtual Ethernet adapters during their creation to determine which  will serve as the primary and which will serve as the backup. The  that has the virtual Ethernet configured with the numerically lesser priority value will be used preferentially as the primary adapter. For the purpose of communicating between themselves to determine when a failover should take place, s in failover mode use a VLAN dedicated for such traffic, called the control channel. For this reason, a virtual Ethernet (created with a PVID that is unique on the system) must be specified as the control channel virtual Ethernet when each  is created in failover mode. Using the control channel, the backup  is notified when the primary adapter fails, and network traffic from the client logical partitions is sent over the backup adapter. If and when the primary  recovers from its failure, it again begins actively bridging all network traffic. A  in failover mode might optionally have more than one trunk virtual Ethernet. In this case, all the virtual Ethernet adapters in a  must have the same priority value. Also, the virtual Ethernet adapter used specifically for the control channel does not need to have the trunk adapter setting enabled. The virtual Ethernet adapters used for the control channel on each  in failover mode must have an identical PVID value, and that PVID value must be unique in the system, so that no other virtual Ethernet adapters on the same system are using that PVID. To ensure prompt recovery times, when you enable the Spanning Tree Protocol on the switch ports connected to the physical adapters of the , you can also enable the portfast option on those ports. The portfast option allows the switch to immediately forward packets on the port without first completing the Spanning Tree Protocol. (Spanning Tree Protocol blocks the port completely until it is finished.) The  is designed to prevent network loops.  However, as an additional precaution, you can enable Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) Guard on the switch ports connected to the physical adapters of the . BPDU Guard detects looped Spanning Tree Protocol BPDU packets and shuts down the port. This helps prevent broadcast storms on the network. A broadcast storm is a situation where one message that is broadcast across a network results in multiple responses. Each response generates more responses, causing excessive transmission of broadcast messages.  Severe broadcast storms can block all other network traffic, but they can usually be prevented by carefully configuring a network to block illegal broadcast messages.   When the  is using GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP), it generates BPDU packets, which causes BPDU Guard to shut down the port unnecessarily. Therefore, when the  is using GVRP, do not enable BPDU Guard. For information about how to enable the Spanning Tree Protocol, the portfast option, and BPDU Guard on the ports, see the documentation provided with the switch.

 Scenario: Configuring  failover Use this scenario to help you to configure primary and backup Shared Ethernet Adapters in the  logical partitions. You are the system administrator responsible for planning and configuring the network in an environment with the  running. You want to provide higher network availability to the client logical partition on the system. This can be accomplished by configuring a backup  in a different  logical partition. The objective of this scenario is to configure primary and backup Shared Ethernet Adapters in the  logical partitions so that network connectivity in the client logical partitions will not be lost in the case of adapter failure.

The following image depicts a configuration where the  failover feature is set up. The client logical partitions H1 and H2 are accessing the physical network using the Shared Ethernet Adapters, which are the primary adapters. The virtual Ethernet adapters used in the shared Ethernet setup are configured with the same VLAN membership information (PVID, VID), but have different priorities. A dedicated virtual network forms the control channel and is required to facilitate communication between the primary and backup shared Ethernet device. Using the preceding figure as a guide, follow these steps:  Configure the virtual adapters to be used for data as trunk adapters by selecting the trunk setting. Assign different prioritization values (valid values are 1-15) to each virtual adapter. Configure another virtual Ethernet to be used for the control channel by giving it a unique PVID value. Make sure you use the same PVID when creating this virtual Ethernet for both  logical partitions.  mkvdev -sea physical_adapter -vadapter virtual_adapter -default  virtual_adapter\ -defaultid PVID_of_virtual_adapter -attr ha_mode=auto  ctl_chan=control_channel_adapter For example, in this scenario, run the following command on both  logical partitions:mkvdev -sea ent0 -vadapter ent1 -default ent1 -defaultid 60 -attr ha_mode=auto  ctl_chan=ent2 Parent topic:

Read about new or changed information in Logical partitioning since the previous update of this topic collection. You can view and print a PDF of the logical partitioning information. Logical partitioning is the ability to make a server run as if it were two or more independent servers. When you logically partition a server, you divide the resources on the server into subsets called logical partitions. You can install software on a logical partition, and the logical partition runs as an independent logical server with the resources that you have allocated to the logical partition.  One of the best ways to learn about logical partitions is to see examples illustrating how many of the applications and functions can be used in a sample business environment. Use these scenarios to learn how you can use logical partitions in your business. You can create logical partitions to distribute resources within a single server and make it function as if it were two or more independent servers. Before creating logical partitions, you must assess your current and future needs. You can then use this information to determine the hardware configuration that will meet your current needs and serve as a base for meeting your future needs.  The  () is a system that controls managed systems, including the management of logical partitions and use of Capacity Upgrade on Demand.

If you have problems with a partitioned system, determine if the problem is specific to logical partitions or is a system problem. If your problem is specific to logical partitions, you can use the reference codes to resolve the error. However, specific recovery actions and tasks might require the assistance of your next level of support.  To perform dynamic partitioning operations, you require a Resource Monitoring and Control (RMC) connection between the logical partition and the  (). If you cannot add or remove processors, memory, or I/O devices to or from a logical partition, check whether the RMC connection is active. Failure of the RMC connection is one of the most common reasons for failure of dynamic partitioning operations.  Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related information:

 Configuring the  for the VSN capability If you are using the  () Version 7 Release 7.7.0, or later, you can use Virtual Station Interface (VSI) profiles with virtual Ethernet adapters in logical partitions and assign the Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) switching mode to virtual Ethernet switches. When you use the Virtual Ethernet Bridge (VEB) switching mode in virtual Ethernet switches, the traffic between logical partitions is not visible to the external switches. However, when you use the VEPA switching mode, the traffic between logical partitions is visible to the external switches. This visibility helps you to use features such as security that are supported by the advanced switching technology. Automated VSI discovery and configuration with the external Ethernet bridges simplifies the switch configuration for the virtual interfaces that are created with logical partitions. The profile-based VSI management policy definition provides flexibility during configuration and maximizes the benefits of automation.  The configuration requirements on the  () to use the VSN capability follow: At least one  logical partition that is servicing the virtual switch must be active and must support the VEPA switching mode. The external switches that are connected to the shared Ethernet adapter must support the VEPA switching mode. The  daemon must be running on the  and must be managing the shared Ethernet adapter. From the  command-line interface, run the  command  to change the value of the lldpsvc attribute of the shared Ethernet adapter device to yes. The default value of the lldpsvc attribute is no. Run the  command to notify the change to the running  daemon. The lldpsvc attribute must be set to the default value before you remove the shared Ethernet adapter. Otherwise, removal of the shared Ethernet adapter fails. For redundancy shared Ethernet adapter setup, the trunk adapters might be attached to a virtual switch that is set to the VEPA mode. In this case, attach the control channel adapters of the shared Ethernet adapter to another virtual switch that is always set to the virtual Ethernet bridging (VEB) mode. The shared Ethernet adapter that is in the high availability mode does not work when the control channel adapter that is associated with the virtual switches is in the VEPA mode.

  for  logical partitions When you enable  for an  logical partition, you increase the memory capacity of the logical partition without assigning more memory to it. The operating system compresses a portion of the memory that the logical partition uses. This compression creates space for more data and expanding the memory capacity of the logical partition. When you expand the memory capacity of a logical partition, you enable the logical partition to do more work with the same amount of memory. This can be especially useful when you want to increase the workload of a logical partition, but cannot assign more memory to the logical partition. When you expand the memory capacity of several logical partitions on a server, you increase the overall memory capacity of the server. This can be especially useful when you want to consolidate more workloads onto the server by creating more logical partitions. You configure the degree of memory expansion that you want to achieve for a logical partition by setting the  factor in a partition profile of the logical partition. The expansion factor is a multiplier of the amount of memory that is assigned to the logical partition. For example, if the amount of memory that is assigned to a logical partition is 25 GB and the expansion factor is set to 2.0, then the desired memory capacity of the logical partition is 50 GB. In this situation, the operating system attempts to compress data such that 50 GB of data fits into 25 GB of memory. After you set the expansion factor, you can monitor the performance of the logical partition and then dynamically change the expansion factor to improve performance. When you configure a logical partition to use , you might also must configure some additional processing resources for the logical partition. The operating system uses the additional processing resources to perform the memory compression. The amount of processing resources that the logical partition requires depends on the workload that is running in the logical partition and the expansion factor that you set for the logical partition.

These properties include port speed, duplex mode, maximum packet size, flow control setting, and the promiscuous logical partition for unicast packets. The physical port properties are also used by the logical ports that are associated with each physical port. HEAs are also known as Integrated Virtual Ethernet adapters (IVE adapters). If your managed system supports more than one shared processor pool, you can use the  () to configure shared processor pools on your managed system in addition to the default shared processor pool. These additional shared processor pools allow you to limit the processor usage of the logical partitions that belong to the shared processor pools. All shared processor pools other than the default shared processor pool must be configured before you can assign logical partitions to these shared processor pools. You can configure the size of the shared memory pool, assign paging space devices to the shared memory pool, and assign one or two  () logical partitions (that provide access to the paging space devices) to the shared memory pool using the  ().

If you plan to configure an Ethernet adapter for a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition), you might need to adjust the amount of I/O entitled memory assigned to the shared memory partition before you configure the adapter:If the I/O entitled memory mode of the shared memory partition is set to the auto mode, you do not need to take action. When you configure the new Ethernet adapter, the  automatically increases the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition to accommodate the new adapter. If the I/O entitled memory mode of the shared memory partition is set to the manual mode, you must increase the I/O entitled memory that is assigned to the shared memory partition to accommodate the new adapter. For instructions, see . To configure a virtual Ethernet adapter dynamically for a running logical partition using the , follow these steps:  The Port VLAN ID allows the virtual Ethernet adapter to communicate with other virtual Ethernet adapters that have the same Port VLAN ID.   If you leave this option unchecked and you want this logical partition to connect to multiple virtual networks, you must create multiple virtual adapters by creating additional VLAN IDs.  You can assign multiple VLAN IDs to a configured virtual Ethernet adapter that is used by a running logical partition without rebooting the logical partition. For a running logical partition, you can remove or edit the VLAN IDs, and configure the Quality of Service (QoS) priority without restarting the logical partition.

 Virtual Ethernet Virtual Ethernet allows logical partitions to communicate with each other without having to assign physical hardware to the logical partitions.  You can create virtual Ethernet adapters on each logical partition and connect these virtual Ethernet adapters to virtual LANs. TCP/IP communications over these virtual LANs is routed through the server firmware.  A virtual Ethernet adapter provides similar function as a 1 Gb Ethernet adapter. A logical partition can use virtual Ethernet adapters to establish multiple high-speed interpartition connections within a single managed system.  Virtual Ethernet adapters are connected to an IEEE 802.1q (VLAN)-style virtual Ethernet switch. Using this switch function, logical partitions can communicate with each other by using virtual Ethernet adapters and assigning VLAN IDs that enable them to share a common logical network. The virtual Ethernet adapters are created and the VLAN ID assignments are done using the  (). The system transmits packets by copying the packet directly from the memory of the sender logical partition to the receive buffers of the receiver logical partition without any intermediate buffering of the packet. You can configure an Ethernet bridge between the virtual LAN and a physical Ethernet adapter that is owned by a   logical partition. The logical partitions on the virtual LAN can communicate with an external Ethernet network through the Ethernet bridge. You can reduce the number of physical Ethernet adapters required for a managed system by routing external communications through the Ethernet bridge. The number of virtual Ethernet adapters allowed for each logical partition varies by operating system.    supports up to 256 virtual Ethernet adapters for each logical partition. Version 2.6 of the  kernel supports up to 32, 768 virtual Ethernet adapters for each logical partition. Each  logical partition can belong to a maximum of 4, 094 virtual LANs. Besides a Port VLAN ID, the number of additional VLAN ID values that can be assigned for each virtual Ethernet adapter is 20, which indicates that each virtual Ethernet adapter can be used to access 21 networks.  When the  is at a level earlier than  Version 7 Release 7.7.0 Service Pack 3 with MH01400, or  Version 7 Release 7.8.0 Service Pack 1, the number of additional VLAN ID values that can be assigned for each virtual Ethernet adapter is 19.  The  generates a locally administered Ethernet MAC address for the virtual Ethernet adapters so that these addresses do not conflict with physical Ethernet adapter MAC addresses. After a specific virtual Ethernet is enabled for a logical partition, a network device is created in the logical partition. This network device is named  logical partitions, where X represents sequentially assigned numbers. The user can then set up TCP/IP configuration similar to a physical Ethernet device to communicate with other logical partitions. If a virtual Ethernet adapter is set for checksum offload, the virtual Ethernet adapter cannot generate a checksum for any packet that the virtual Ethernet adapter sends to a multicast or broadcast MAC address.  Some managed systems contain a  (HEA). A  (HEA) is a physical Ethernet adapter that is integrated directly into the GX+ bus on a managed system. HEAs are also known as Integrated Virtual Ethernet adapters (IVE adapters). Unlike most other types of I/O devices, you can never assign the HEA itself to a logical partition. Instead, multiple logical partitions can connect directly to the HEA and use the HEA resources. This allows these logical partitions to access external networks through the HEA without having to go through an Ethernet bridge on another logical partition. You can enable and disable individual virtual Ethernet adapters by using the  (). You can use the  command to enable or disable a virtual Ethernet adapter. A particular logical partition can be removed from the network when the virtual Ethernet adapter is disabled. You can reconnect the logical partition to the network by enabling the virtual Ethernet adapter. To reconnect the logical partition, you must use a virtual Ethernet that is bridged by using a Shared Ethernet Adapter (SEA) in the  (). The status of the virtual Ethernet adapter can be queried at any time by using the  command. The disabled state persists during partition restart. Trunk adapters cannot be disabled. You must have super administrator or product engineer access to the  to enable or disable a virtual Ethernet adapter. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks:         
 Virtual adapters With virtual adapters, you can connect logical partitions with each other without using physical hardware. Operating systems can display, configure, and use virtual adapters just like they can display, configure, and use physical adapters. Depending on the operating environment used by the logical partition, you can create virtual Ethernet adapters, virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapters, and virtual serial adapters for a logical partition. The system administrator uses the following tools to create virtual adapters:  () Adapters can be added while the system is running using dynamic partitioning. The virtual adapters are recorded in system inventory and management utilities. Converged location codes can be used to correlate operating-system level or partition-level software entities to adapters, such as eth0 and en0. Similarly, the Ethernet adapters are visible in the same way as physical Ethernet adapters. By default, virtual Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are created from the locally administered range. Using the default MAC addresses, it is possible that different servers will have virtual Ethernet adapters with the same addresses. This situation can present a problem if multiple, virtual networks are bridged to the same physical network. If a server logical partition providing I/O for a client logical partition fails, the client logical partition might continue to function, depending on the significance of the hardware it is using. For example, if one logical partition is providing the paging volume for another logical partition, a failure of the logical partition providing that particular resource will be significant to the other logical partition.  However, if the shared resource is a tape drive, a failure of the server logical partition providing the resource will have only minimal effects on the client logical partition. Client support for virtual I/OThe following table summarizes operating system support for using virtual I/O devices. Client operating system Virtual console Virtual Ethernet Virtual disk Virtual optical Virtual tape Yes Yes Yes Yes, on HMC-managed systems, at least one  logical partition must be present Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  logical partitions support booting from virtual devices, including disk boot from virtual disk, network boot from virtual Ethernet, and tape boot from virtual tape. The firmware running in  logical partitions recognizes virtual I/O and can start the logical partition from virtual I/O. An IPL can be done either from the network over virtual Ethernet or from a device such as virtual disk or virtual CD. Server support for virtual I/OThe following table summarizes operating system support for providing virtual I/O to logical partitions. Server Virtual optical Virtual console Virtual disk Virtual tape Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No No Yes Yes Yes Yes  provides SCSI disk, shared Ethernet, virtual optical The  also provides a virtual console to  logical partitions.  provides disk, CD, tape, and console functions to logical partitions that use  resources.  uses standard network server storage and network server descriptions to provide disk, CD, and tape resources to other logical partitions. An  logical partition cannot simultaneously provide virtual resources to other logical partitions and use virtual resources provided by another  logical partition or by the  logical partition.  To configure virtual I/O for the logical partitions on your managed system, you must create virtual I/O adapters on the  or . Virtual I/O adapters are usually created when you create your logical partitions. Alternatively, you can add virtual I/O adapters to running logical partitions using dynamic partitioning. After you create a virtual I/O adapter, you can then access the operating system used by the logical partition and complete the configuration of the virtual I/O adapter in the operating system software. For  partitions, virtual adapters are listed in the device tree. The device tree contains  adapters, not the devices under the adapter. Logical A logical  (LHEA) is a special type of virtual adapter. Even though an LHEA is a virtual resource, an LHEA can exist only if a physical , or Integrated Virtual Ethernet, provides its resources to the LHEA. Virtual Ethernet allows logical partitions to communicate with each other without having to assign physical hardware to the logical partitions.  With N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV), you can configure the managed system so that multiple logical partitions can access independent physical storage through the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. Virtual SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) adapters provide one logical partition with the ability to use storage I/O (disk, CD, and tape) that is owned by another logical partition. Virtual serial adapters provide a point-to-point connection from one logical partition to another, or from the  () to each logical partition on the managed system. Virtual serial adapters are used primarily to establish terminal connections to logical partitions.  Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks:         
 Virtual SCSI adapters Virtual SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) adapters provide one logical partition with the ability to use storage I/O (disk, CD, and tape) that is owned by another logical partition.  A  client adapter in one logical partition can communicate with a  server adapter in another logical partition. The  client adapter allows a logical partition to access a storage device being made available by the other logical partition. The logical partition owning the hardware is the server logical partition, and the logical partition that uses the virtualized hardware is the client logical partition. With this arrangement, the system can have many server logical partitions. For example, logical partition A provides disk space to logical partitions B, C, and D. A logical partition can simultaneously use virtual I/O from more than one logical partition. Therefore, using the example, while logical partition A provides disk space to logical partitions B, C, and D, logical partitions A and B can use a tape drive connected to logical partition D. In this case, A is serving D for disk space, while D is serving A for the tape device. Virtual SCSI allows you to simplify the backup and maintenance operations on your managed system. When you back up the data on the server logical partition, you also back up the data on each client logical partition.  Virtual SCSI server adapters can be created only in logical partitions of type Virtual I/O Server. The virtual SCSI client device driver is not capable of storage protection using Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID).  While the  operating system allows software RAID protection of virtual disks, the recommended technique for protecting disk storage is to configure the virtual I/O storage server to perform the disk protection. For -managed systems, virtual SCSI adapters are created and assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Virtual serial adapters Virtual serial adapters provide a point-to-point connection from one logical partition to another, or from the  () to each logical partition on the managed system. Virtual serial adapters are used primarily to establish terminal connections to logical partitions.  When you create a logical partition, the  automatically creates two virtual server serial adapters on the logical partition. These virtual server serial adapters allow you to establish a terminal connection to the logical partition through the . You can also create pairs of virtual serial adapters on logical partitions so that you can access and control one logical partition directly from another logical partition. For example, one logical partition uses the disk resources of another logical partition using virtual SCSI adapters. You can create a server serial adapter on the logical partition that uses the disk resources and a client serial adapter on the logical partition that owns the disk resources. This connection allows the logical partition that owns the disk resources to shut down the logical partition that uses the disk resources before you back up data on the logical partition that owns the disk resources. On -managed systems, virtual serial adapters are created and assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 I/O devices I/O devices allow your managed system to gather, store, and transmit data. I/O devices are found in the server unit itself and in expansion units that are attached to the server. I/O devices can be embedded into the unit, or they can be installed into physical slots.  Not all types of I/O devices are supported for all operating systems or on all server models. For example, Switch Network Interface (SNI) adapters are supported only on certain server models.  Single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) allows virtualization of the physical ports of an adapter so that the ports can be shared by multiple partitions that are running simultaneously. To share the ports of an SR-IOV capable adapter, the adapter must first be enabled for the SR-IOV shared mode.  After an adapter is enabled for SR-IOV shared mode, SR-IOV logical ports can be assigned to logical partitions.   Some PCI adapters and embedded controllers require multiple PCI or PCI-E slots to be associated with them. Carefully review the PCI or PCI-E slot assignments for each logical partition to ensure that the slot configuration of the logical partition meets the adapter functional requirements. For details, see , and . With virtual adapters, you can connect logical partitions with each other without using physical hardware. Operating systems can display, configure, and use virtual adapters just like they can display, configure, and use physical adapters. Depending on the operating environment used by the logical partition, you can create virtual Ethernet adapters, virtual Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) adapters, and virtual serial adapters for a logical partition. The virtual OptiConnect feature provides high-speed interpartition communication within a managed system. The Virtual OptiConnect feature emulates external OptiConnect hardware by providing a virtual bus between logical partitions. You can add expansion units to many of the models to support additional features and devices. If you want to create logical partitions on your server, you must add an expansion unit that contains the additional hardware that you need for each logical partition.

Always lower the leveling pads on the rack cabinet. Always install stabilizer brackets on the rack cabinet. To avoid hazardous conditions due to uneven mechanical loading, always install the heaviest devices in the bottom of the rack cabinet.  Always install servers and optional devices starting from the bottom of the rack cabinet. Rack-mounted devices are not to be used as shelves or work spaces.  Do not place objects on top of rack-mounted devices. Each rack cabinet might have more than one power cord.  Be sure to disconnect all power cords in the rack cabinet when directed to disconnect power during servicing. Connect all devices installed in a rack cabinet to power devices installed in the same rack cabinet.  Do not plug a power cord from a device installed in one rack cabinet into a power device installed in a different rack cabinet. An electrical outlet that is not correctly wired could place hazardous voltage on the metal parts of the system or the devices that attach to the system.  It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that the outlet is correctly wired and grounded to prevent an electrical shock. CAUTION Do not install a unit in a rack where the internal rack ambient temperatures will exceed the manufacturer's recommended ambient temperature for all your rack-mounted devices. Do not install a unit in a rack where the air flow is compromised.  Ensure that air flow is not blocked or reduced on any side, front, or back of a unit used for air flow through the unit. Consideration should be given to the connection of the equipment to the supply circuit so that overloading of the circuits does not compromise the supply wiring or overcurrent protection.  To provide the correct power connection to a rack, refer to the rating labels located on the equipment in the rack to determine the total power requirement of the supply circuit. (For sliding drawers.)   Do not pull out or install any drawer or feature if the rack stabilizer brackets are not attached to the rack. Do not pull out more than one drawer at a time.  The rack might become unstable if you pull out more than one drawer at a time. (For fixed drawers.) This drawer is a fixed drawer and must not be moved for servicing unless specified by the manufacturer.  Attempting to move the drawer partially or completely out of the rack might cause the rack to become unstable or cause the drawer to fall out of the rack.  (R001) CAUTION:Removing components from the upper positions in the rack cabinet improves rack stability during relocation.  Follow these general guidelines whenever you relocate a populated rack cabinet within a room or building: Reduce the weight of the rack cabinet by removing equipment starting at the top of the rack cabinet.  When possible, restore the rack cabinet to the configuration of the rack cabinet as you received it.  If this configuration is not known, you must observe the following precautions:Remove all devices in the 32U position and above. Ensure that the heaviest devices are installed in the bottom of the rack cabinet. Ensure that there are no empty U-levels between devices installed in the rack cabinet below the 32U level.    If the rack cabinet you are relocating is part of a suite of rack cabinets, detach the rack cabinet from the suite. Inspect the route that you plan to take to eliminate potential hazards. Verify that the route that you choose can support the weight of the loaded rack cabinet.  Refer to the documentation that comes with your rack cabinet for the weight of a loaded rack cabinet. Verify that all door openings are at least 760 x 230 mm (30 x 80 in.). Ensure that all devices, shelves, drawers, doors, and cables are secure. Ensure that the four leveling pads are raised to their highest position. Ensure that there is no stabilizer bracket installed on the rack cabinet during movement. Do not use a ramp inclined at more than 10 degrees. When the rack cabinet is in the new location, complete the following steps:Lower the four leveling pads. Install stabilizer brackets on the rack cabinet. If you removed any devices from the rack cabinet, repopulate the rack cabinet from the lowest position to the highest position. If a long-distance relocation is required, restore the rack cabinet to the configuration of the rack cabinet as you received it.  Pack the rack cabinet in the original packaging material, or equivalent.  Also lower the leveling pads to raise the casters off of the pallet and bolt the rack cabinet to the pallet.

 Tape drives Learn general information about tape drives. Select the appropriate information from this list: Tape drive overviewYour tape drive must be installed in the cleanest possible environment. Additionally, tape drives require high quality, data grade tapes and cleaning on a regular basis. Media must also be stored and handled properly. Improper use, storage or handling of tape drives or media may void your warranty or service agreement.  If a tape drive stops functioning due to a component failure during the tape drive warranty or maintenance time, the tape drive supplier will replace the tape drive unit. The tape drive supplier will replace any defective tape drive under the terms and conditions of the warranty or service agreement.  The tape drive is a streaming device used primarily for: Saving and restoring system data files Archiving important records Distributing operating system software upgrades  The following information describes hardware features and functions. While the hardware supports them, the availability of these features and functions depends upon support from the operating system. For information about support for features and functions, see the documentation for your operating system. Tape drive environment and useTape drives require specific maintenance and environmental conditions to operate well over time. Using high-quality, data-grade media, handling and storing this media correctly, operating the tape drive in a clean environment, and keeping the tape drive correctly cleaned can help you to avoid problems with your tape drive. If a tape drive stops functioning due to a component failure during the tape drive warranty or maintenance time, the service provider will replace the tape drive unit. The service provider will replace any defective tape drive under the terms and conditions of its warranty or service agreement. It is the service provider's objective to work with you to identify the cause of any tape-drive problem and provide a solution. Tape handling and storageMost tape is supplied in a sealed cartridge so that the tape will remain clean. Opening the cartridge allows dirt and airborne particles to enter and then become a source of contamination. The cartridge should only be opened by the tape drive and not an operator. The tape also is held under proper tension inside the cartridge. If the cartridge is dropped, this tension will be relaxed.  Inserting a dropped cartridge into a tape drive can cause incorrect loading and result in a jam. This action will ruin the tape and can cause physical damage if the cartridge is not removed correctly. When the tapes are stored, they must be replaced in their protective containers and stored on their end. The storage area must be clean, dry, at normal room temperature, and away from any magnetic fields. Improper use, storage, or handling of tape drives or media might void your warranty or service agreement. Environmental issuesTape drives are designed to operate in a clean environment.  Problems can be caused by dirt, dust, fibers, and airborne particles. Airborne particles are the most difficult to address. When a tape is installed into the tape drive, the clearance between the heads and the tape is measured in microns. Particles can damage the tape or the head if they come in contact with either. Customers are responsible to provide a clean operating environment for the tape drive and system. Tape drive cleaningNo matter how clean the environment, debris can build up on the heads of any tape drive. Every time tape motion occurs, some of the media surface comes off on the heads. Over time, this surface builds up and causes errors in reading and writing. Customers are responsible to clean the tape drive in accordance with the cleaning information that was provided with the tape drive. Cleaning cartridges can be used a limited number of times. After a cleaning cartridge has been used to its maximum number of times, the cartridge is considered expired. When cartridges expire, they must be replaced. Never reuse an expired cleaning cartridge. Doing so allows previously removed dirt to be reintroduced to the tape drive. Place a mark on the cleaning cartridge after each use, to best determine when your cleaning cartridge has expired. SCSI hardware issues If you are installing the auto-docking version of this device on your system, this section does not apply to your system. For information about the auto-docking feature, see your system documentation. SCSI bus cables and terminators can affect tape drive performance. Use cables and terminators that are designed specifically to keep the SCSI bus as free of noise as possible. Generic cables or terminators can adversely affect the SCSI bus performance.  If your service provider's analysis indicates a problem with inferior cables, it might be necessary for the customer to replace them. Microcode updatesTo make certain that the tape drives work their best, your system supplier might release changed microcode for the tape drives. When a microcode change is developed, your system supplier makes the change available to you through its service organization or by electronic delivery. You might be responsible for installing new microcode as it becomes available. However, microcode can be installed by your service provider or your system administrator. For more information, contact your authorized service provider. Parent topic:  Parent topic:

 Tape drive media  Your system supplier might support only the media that it sells. If the supplier's analysis indicates that the problem is caused by using inferior media, it is the customer's responsibility to replace the inferior media. Select the appropriate information from this list:   Types of cartridgesTape devices use the following media cartridges.  Data cartridge Use the data cartridge to save or restore programs or data. Test cartridge Use the specially labeled test cartridge to run the AIXÂ® system diagnostics (for information about running diagnostics, refer to your AIX documentation). Do not use the test cartridge to save or restore customer programs or data. Cleaning cartridge Use the specially labeled cleaning cartridge to clean the device.  Use of other than the  specified cleaning cartridge can damage your device and might void your warranty.  To order additional cartridges, refer to . Recommendations for data cartridge usage The following list describes recommended guidelines that will help to protect your data and prolong the life of your tape cartridges and the device:  Use only the tape cartridge specified for your type of tape device. Remove the tape cartridge from the drive when the drive is not in use. Back up and then discard any tape cartridge that repeatedly produces error messages (the error information is in the System Error Log). On the data cartridge, do not open the door that covers the tape. The door protects the tape from dirt, dust, and damage. Do not touch the tape. Any substance transferred to the tape by touching could cause loss of data. To avoid problems with loading and unloading, use only one label on a cartridge. Multiple or poorly placed labels can clog the drive load mechanism. Do not use poor-quality tape cartridges. They can cause excessive read or write errors, and they might damage the tape drive. Discard any tape cartridges that are dropped, because the impact might damage the tape's internal mechanism. Make sure the environment is kept clean and constant. Do not operate in a dusty environment and always maintain a constant environment. A consistent storage and operating environment reduces media exposure to climatic stress.  Use only the recommended cleaning cartridge to clean the tape drive. Use of other than recommended cleaning cartridges can damage your drive and might void the warranty. Printers and copiers can produce paper dust and toner dust. Locate the tape unit away from these items. High traffic areas near hallways and doors can also produce excess dust and dirt. Record all important information on the tape label. Information, such as the model and number of the system or tape drive, the date, the density, any error statistics, and include a log number. Also note the operating environment and compression mode.  Prolonging head lifeNew technology found in the tape device is read and write compatible with newer tape cartridges. Due to media characteristics, extended use of older tape cartridges might increase head wear on the drive. An indication of this head wear is an increase in soft (recoverable) errors. Using newer tape cartridges may have enhanced characteristics that can reduce drive head wear and maximize the overall advantages of the tape device. Storage and shipping environmentsBefore using a tape cartridge, let it acclimatize to the operating environment by placing the cartridge in the operating environment for as long as it has been away from the environment or for 24 hours, whichever is less. Acclimatization is necessary for any data cartridge exposed to an environmental change in humidity or to temperature changes of 11Â°C (20Â°F) or more. To determine the appropriate operating environment, see . Retrieval of archived data can be performed on a tape unit that is clean and fully operational. Try to make the recovery environment the same as the operating environment. Allow tapes at least 24 hours to acclimatize to the environment of the tape unit.  The recommended environment for storage and shipment of cartridges is shown in .

Because most computer systems are not located in a dust-free, climate-controlled environment, you must exercise special care when dealing with tape cartridges and tape drives. They must be treated as a valuable asset used to protect your business data. Use the following guidelines for storing your tape cartridges:  Keep temperature and humidity constant at the levels listed in . Always store tape cartridges in their protective cases. The storage case helps prevent damage from dust and physical misuse.  When the tape cartridges are not in use or being stored, keep them in their storage cases and stand on edge in a designated storage location. Do not stack cartridges on the flat side or stack other items on top of the tape cartridges. Handle your tape cartridges with care to reduce archival problems. Keep protective cases for tape cartridges closed except when inserting or removing a cartridge. Contamination can build up and be transferred to the tape cartridge if the protective case is left open. Exercise stored tapes at least once every 12 months. Run the tape from Beginning of Data (BOD) to End of Data (EOD) and back to BOD at normal operating speeds. Exercise tapes stored in a warmer environment more frequently. Sunlight can damage the tape and the cartridge shell. Store tape cartridges out of the direct sunlight.   Operation outside of the recommended environment can result in possible loss of data or failure of the drive. Operating in harsh environmentsThe device is suited to streaming operations, as opposed to multiple stop-and-start, random-search tape operations.  When the tape is used for frequent stop-and-start operations, it is beneficial to still have as much streaming movement as possible.  This can be accomplished by ensuring that any save or restore operation is the only active operation being performed. Do not use any tape for archival purposes if it has been used outside of the ranges specified in  for an extended period of time.  The magnetic and physical strength of the tape will have deteriorated as a result of its exposure to the environment.  Do not store important data on such a tape; transfer the data to a newer tape for reliable archiving. Ordering tape and data cartridgesAll tape cartridges are not alike. The tape composition and length, and the construction of the cartridge itself can all affect the quality and capacity of the recording and the performance of your tape drive. A poor quality tape cartridge might appear to work adequately in your system, yet it can leave contamination in the tape path or impede the speed of the recording. The length and composition of the tape, and the size, shape, and construction of the cartridge shell must all be considered when selecting the tape cartridge to be used with your system.  using only data and cleaning cartridges supplied by . Use only data-grade tape media for backup and data processing.  To order cartridges in the United States and Canada, call 1-888-IBM-MEDIA, or got to.

 Cleaning the tape drive (FC 5746) Clean the device whenever the Fault status light comes on and a C is displayed in the single-character display (SCD), or when a system I/O error occurs that is related to the device. Use only the recommended cleaning cartridge to clean the tape drive. Use of other than the recommended cleaning cartridges can damage your drive and might void the warranty. The tape drive will set the cleaning indicator when one of the following conditions occurs: The tape drive exceeds internal preset error thresholds in the drive.  The tape drive exceeds the maximum recommended time between cleaning.  This is an internal drive calculation where the drive maintains information on the amount of data written and read and when this value reaches a total of approximately 20 full tape writes or reads the drive will request cleaning. The cleaning indicator will be turned on when the tape is ejected.   There is a write or read failure of the tape drive to the data cartridge.   When a cleaning cartridge that has been used the maximum number of times is inserted in the drive, the drive will turn on the fault indicator.   The SCD displays 6 or 7 to indicate that the cleaning process is not done and the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable.    To clean the tape drive, complete the following steps:   After the cleaning cartridge has been inserted, the remainder of the cleaning process is automatic. The tape drive does the following actions: Loads the cleaning cartridge into the tape drive. Cleans the drive by moving the cleaning tape forward for approximately 30 seconds. Unloads the cleaning cartridge when the cleaning operation is complete. Indicates a successful cleaning operation by turning off the C in the SCD, if the C in the SCD was on prior to the cleaning process.   If the cleaning operation is completed but the C in the SCD remains on, the cleaning cartridge might not be usable. Repeat the cleaning procedure with a new cleaning cartridge. If the C in the SCD still remains on, contact your authorized service provider. To determine how many times a cleaning cartridge can be used, check the information printed on the cartridge. If you attempt to use a depleted cleaning cartridge the fault indicator will be turned on and the SCD displays 6 or 7 to indicate that the cleaning process was not done and the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable.  If a system error occurs, clean the drive and retry the operation. If the operation fails, replace the data cartridge, clean the drive again, and then retry the operation. Parent topic:

 Cleaning the tape drive (FC 1124) Clean the device whenever the Fault status light comes on or a system I/O error related to the device occurs. Use only the recommended cleaning cartridge to clean the tape drive. Use of other than recommended cleaning cartridges can damage your drive and might void the warranty. The cleaning cartridge for this drive is P/N 23R5638. The cartridge is physically larger than previous cleaning cartridges and it is the only cleaning cartridge that can be used in this drive.  The older, narrower cleaning cartridges do not work in the 1124 tape drive and are ejected from the drive without cleaning the drive. The tape drive will turn on the cleaning indicator for the following reasons:The tape drive exceeds internal preset error thresholds in the drive.  A cleaning cartridge that has been used the maximum number of times is inserted in the drive. The cleaning indicator is turned on to indicate that the cleaning process was not done and the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. The tape drive exceeds the maximum recommended time between cleaning. The maximum recommended time between preventive-maintenance cleaning is 50 tape motion hours. Tape motion hours are defined as the time that the tape drive is moving tape. If the tape drive reaches 50 tape motion hours since the tape drives was last cleaned, the drive will turn on the cleaning required LED to  indicate the drive needs cleaning.  The tape drive will continue to operate but the tape drive should be cleaned at the next opportunity to insert a cleaning cartridge.  Operating the tape drive in a low-humidity environment causes the drive to request cleaning more often than in normal humidity environment.  In extreme low-humidity conditions of less than 15% relative humidity, the tape drive might request cleaning every 10 tape motion hours or even more frequently. For this reason, it is best not to use the tape drive in extremely low-humidity environments.  To clean the tape drive, complete the following steps:   After the cleaning cartridge has been inserted, the remainder of the cleaning process is automatic. The tape drive does the following actions: Loads the cleaning cartridge into the tape drive. Cleans the drive by moving the cleaning tape forward for approximately 30 seconds. Unloads the cleaning cartridge when the cleaning operation is complete. Indicates a successful cleaning operation by turning off the Cleaning status light (if the Cleaning light was on prior to the cleaning process. Otherwise, the Cleaning light remains solid to indicate that the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. Obtain a new cleaning cartridge and repeat the process.) If the cleaning operation completes but the Cleaning light remains on, repeat the cleaning procedure with a new cleaning cartridge. If the light still remain on, contact your authorized service representative. If you attempt to use a depleted cleaning cartridge, the drive automatically detects the error and ejects the cartridge. If the Cleaning status light was on prior to the cleaning process, it stays on; if the Cleaning light was off, the depleted cartridge causes the light to come on. If a system error occurs, clean the drive and retry the operation. If the operation fails, replace the data cartridge, clean the drive again, then retry the operation. Parent topic:          
 Loading and unloading tape cartridges  To avoid problems with loading and unloading tape cartridges use only one label on a cartridge. If the tape cartridge has too many labels or poorly placed labels, the drive-load mechanism might clog. Parent topic:  Parent topic:  Parent topic:  Parent topic:  Loading a tape cartridge To load a tape cartridge, complete the following steps:   Make sure that the write-protect switch is correctly set. To indicate that the load operation was successful, the ready status light comes on. Unloading a tape cartridge To unload a tape cartridge, complete the following steps:  The device rewinds, unloads, and ejects the tape cartridge. The process might take from 15 seconds to several minutes, depending on the position of the tape and the amount of data written. During this task, the status lights do the following sequence:The ready status light turns off. The activity status light flashes during the unload operation. The activity status light turns off when the cartridge is ejected from the tape drive.  An emergency eject and reset feature can be used to release the tape cartridge and to reset the drive. Use the emergency eject feature if the cartridge does not move correctly or if the unload process fails.  The emergency eject and reset feature procedure might result in loss of data. To perform an emergency eject operation of the tape cartridge or a reset operation of the drive, press and hold the Unload button for at least 10 seconds.

 Cleaning the tape drive (FC EU16) Clean the device whenever the Fault status light comes on or a system I/O error related to the device occurs. Use only the recommended cleaning cartridge to clean the tape drive. Use of other than recommended cleaning cartridges can damage your drive and might void the warranty. The cleaning cartridge for this drive is P/N 23R5638. The cartridge is physically larger than previous cleaning cartridges and it is the only cleaning cartridge that can be used in this drive.  The older, narrower cleaning cartridges do not work in the 5619 tape drive and are ejected from the drive without cleaning the drive. The tape drive will turn on the cleaning indicator for the The tape drive exceeds internal preset error thresholds in the drive.  A cleaning cartridge that has been used the maximum number of times is inserted in the drive. The cleaning indicator is turned on to indicate that the cleaning process was not done and the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. The tape drive exceeds the maximum recommended time between cleaning. The maximum recommended time between preventive-maintenance cleaning is 50 tape motion hours. Tape motion hours are defined as the time that the tape drive is moving tape. If the tape drive reaches 50 tape motion hours since the tape drives was last cleaned, the drive will turn on the cleaning required LED to  indicate the drive needs cleaning.  The tape drive will continue to operate but the tape drive should be cleaned at the next opportunity to insert a cleaning cartridge.  Operating the tape drive in a low-humidity environment causes the drive to request cleaning more often than in normal humidity environment.  In extreme low-humidity conditions of less than 15% relative humidity, the tape drive might request cleaning every 10 tape motion hours or even more frequently. For this reason, it is best not to use the tape drive in extremely low-humidity environments.  To clean the tape drive, complete the following steps:   After the cleaning cartridge has been inserted, the remainder of the cleaning process is automatic. The tape drive does the following actions: Loads the cleaning cartridge into the tape drive. Cleans the drive by moving the cleaning tape forward for approximately 30 seconds. Unloads the cleaning cartridge when the cleaning operation is complete. Indicates a successful cleaning operation by turning off the Cleaning status light (if the Cleaning light was on prior to the cleaning process. Otherwise, the Cleaning light remains solid to indicate that the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. Obtain a new cleaning cartridge and repeat the process.) If the cleaning operation completes but the Cleaning light remains on, repeat the cleaning procedure with a new cleaning cartridge. If the light still remain on, contact your authorized service representative. If you attempt to use a depleted cleaning cartridge, the drive automatically detects the error and ejects the cartridge. If the Cleaning status light was on prior to the cleaning process, it stays on; if the Cleaning light was off, the depleted cartridge causes the light to come on. If a system error occurs, clean the drive and retry the operation. If the operation fails, replace the data cartridge, clean the drive again, then retry the operation. Parent topic:

 Eject button functions on the tape drive (FC 5638) You might need to eject a tape, reset the drive, or place the drive in maintenance mode. Use the information in this topic to perform these tasks. The drive has an eject button that enables you to perform the functions shown in the following table. The eject button is illustrated in . Function How to start the function Reset the drive Press and hold the Unload Button until the drive begins the reset procedure (status light will be amber). If a tape cartridge is loaded in the drive, the drive will unload the tape. Repeat the reset procedure after the tape is unloaded. The drive saves a dump of the current drive state, and then reboots to allow communication. Do not cycle power as this will erase the contents of the dump. Rewind the tape into the cartridge and eject the cartridge from the tape drive Press the Unload Button once. The status light flashes green while the drive is rewinding and unloading. During a rewind and eject operation, the drive does not accept SCSI commands from the server. Place the tape drive in maintenance mode Ensure that the drive is unloaded. Then, press and hold the Unload Button for 6 seconds. The drive is in maintenance mode when the Status Light becomes solid amber and 0 appears in the SCD. While in maintenance mode, the drive does not accept SCSI commands. If you attempt to enter maintenance mode with a cartridge in the drive, the drive will rewind and eject the cartridge. Remove the cartridge and repeat the steps for entering maintenance mode. Scroll through the maintenance functions While in maintenance mode, press the Unload Button once per second to increment the display characters by one. When you reach the character of the diagnostic or maintenance function that you want (see ), press and hold the Unload Button for three seconds. Exit maintenance mode Press the Unload Button once per second until 0 is displayed. Then press and hold the Unload Button for three seconds. Maintenance mode is exited when the Status Light becomes solid green and the SCD becomes blank. Force a drive dump (part of the maintenance mode)  If the drive detects a permanent error and displays an error code, it automatically forces a drive dump (also known as a save of the firmware trace). If you force a drive dump, the existing dump will be overwritten and data will be lost. After you force a drive dump, do not turn off the power to the drive or you might lose the dump data. Choose one of the following procedures:If the drive is in maintenance mode (status light is solid amber), see  to view the available maintenance functions.

 Cleaning the tape drive (FC 5638) Clean the LTO-5 tape drive whenever C displays on the Single-character Display and the Status Light is flashing amber once per second or when a system I/O error related to the device occurs. It is not recommended that you clean the drive head on a periodic basis; only when the drive requests to be cleaned. The LTO-5 tape drive monitors the amount of time between cleaning operations and displays the C when required. Use only the recommended cleaning cartridge to clean the tape drive. Use of other than the recommended cleaning cartridges can damage your drive and might void the warranty.  In Maintenance Mode, a flashing C with the solid amber Fault LED indicates that a cartridge should be inserted. This does not indicate that the drive head requires cleaning. To clean the LTO tape drive, complete the following steps:   The IBM cleaning cartridge is designed to be used for 50 cleanings. Once a cleaning cartridge has been used to its maximum number of uses, the cartridge is considered expired. When the cleaning cartridge has been used 50 times, discard the cleaning cartridge. The LTO tape drive will detect, and automatically eject, an expired cartridge. Using the cleaning cartridge more than 50 times can cause debris to be deposited on the drive head, which may result in errors or inferior data quality. After the cleaning cartridge has been inserted, the remainder of the cleaning process is automatic. The tape drive: Loads the cleaning cartridge into the tape drive. Cleans the drive using the cleaning tape. Cleaning time may take from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, depending upon the number of times that the cleaning cartridge has been used. Unloads the cleaning cartridge when the cleaning operation is complete.  If the cleaning operation is completed but the C in the SCD remains on, the cleaning cartridge might not be usable. Repeat the cleaning procedure with a new cleaning cartridge. If the C in the SCD still remains on, contact your authorized service provider. To determine how many times a cleaning cartridge can be used, check the information printed on the cartridge. If you attempt to use a depleted cleaning cartridge the fault indicator will be turned on and the SCD displays 6 or 7 to indicate that the cleaning process was not done and the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. If the fault indicator was lit and a C was in the SCD prior to the cleaning process, the indicators will stay on after the depleted cleaning cartridge is removed. If these indicators were off prior to inserting the depleted cleaning cartridge, they will turn off once the depleted cleaning cartridge is removed from the drive. If a system error occurs, clean the drive and retry the operation. If the operation fails, replace the data cartridge, clean the drive again, and then retry the operation. Parent topic:          
 Maintenance mode (FC 5638) Learn about using maintenance mode functions on the 5638 tape drive. Performing operations using the front panel Perform maintenance operations by pushing the eject button while observing the status LED and the single-character display. Entering maintenance mode The drive must be in maintenance mode to run drive diagnostics or maintenance functions. To place the unit in maintenance mode:Make sure that no cartridge is in the drive. Press and hold the Unload Button for 6 seconds. A 0 appears in the Single-character Display (SCD), and the Fault Light turns amber.  If a cartridge is in the tape drive, it will eject the first time that you press the Unload Button and the drive will not be placed in maintenance mode. To continue placing the drive in maintenance mode, perform the preceding step. While in Maintenance Mode, the drive will not accept a cartridge unless the drive requests it. The SCD will display a flashing C to indicate a cartridge needs to be inserted. Maintenance functions cannot be performed concurrently with read or write operations. While in maintenance mode, the drive does not receive commands from the server. Scrolling through maintenance optionsWith the drive in maintenance mode, press the eject push button at a rate of once per second. The single-character display code increments by one each time you press the eject push button.    Do not press the eject push button more frequently than once per second or the selected maintenance function will occur instead of the desired scrolling operation.  After the last maintenance function is reached, the display code wraps to 0. Unassigned digits (B, D, and G) are not displayed when the options are incremented. 	The following table lists the maintenance functions. Maintenance functions Display code Normal mode  None Maintenance mode  0 Run drive diagnostics  1 Update drive firmware from FMR tape 2 Create FMR tape  3 Force a drive dump (same as pressing the eject button for 10 or more seconds, except it does not cause a reset operation) 4 Copy drive dump to tape at the beginning of tape 5 Copy drive dump to tape  5-1 Copy drive dump to flash memory  5-8 Clear flash dump  5-3 No function 5 -0 Run host interface wrap test 6 Test the primary SAS port  6-1 Test the secondary SAS port 6-8 Test both primary and secondary SAS ports at the same time (requires a wrap plug in both ports) 6-3 Exit 6-0 Run RS-422 wrap test 7 Unmake FMR tape 8 Display error code log  9 Clear error code log  A Insert cartridge into tape drive  C Test cartridge and media  E Write performance test F Test head  H Fast read/write test  J Load/unload test L Enable post-error reporting P Disable post-error reporting U Running a maintenance functionTo run the maintenance function indicated by the character on the single-character display, press and hold the eject button for 2 seconds.  The single digit flashes the selected maintenance function code during the running of the operation.  If the drive runs the function successfully, the single-character display indicates 0.  If the function fails, the status LED indicates continuous yellow and the single-character display indicates the reason for the error by displaying an error code. For a meaning of status lights and single-character display, see . Exiting maintenance modeThe drive must be in maintenance mode to run drive diagnostics or maintenance functions. To exit maintenance mode:Press and hold the Unload Button for 3 or more seconds then release the button to take the drive out of maintenance mode. If no error is detected, 0 temporarily appears in the SCD, then goes blank. The drive then exits maintenance mode and the Status Light will return to Green. If an error is detected, the SCD shows an error code but still exits maintenance mode. To clear the error, turn the power off, then on again.  The drive also exits maintenance mode automatically after it completes a maintenance function or after 10 minutes if no action has occurred. Running a dump operation when not in maintenance mode To perform a drive dump operation, press and hold the eject button for 10 or more seconds.  The microcode goes to its initialized state after a dump operation.  Data from a dump operation is for use by trained personnel for problem determination. Parent topic:          
 Performing the internal self-test (FC 5638) Use the information in this section to perform an internal self-test on your tape drive. This procedure is designed to allow you to quickly perform a complete set of diagnostic tests on your LTO-4 tape drive, without impacting server operation.  This 4-minute test can also be used to verify good performance of individual LTO tape cartridges. For an illustration of the tape drive and the LED status lights that are referred to in this procedure, see . PrerequisitesIn order to perform the test you need a blank LTO-5 (Ultrium 5) data cartridge. If an Ultrium-5 data cartridge is not available, an Ultrium-4 cartridge can be substituted. Performing the testFollow these steps to perform the test: Use a blank data cartridge to perform the test. During the test, the tape will be overwritten with a test pattern and all data on the tape will be destroyed. Enter diagnostic mode by doing the following steps:Verify that a tape cartridge is not loaded in the drive. To unload a cartridge, press the eject button on the front of the drive.  Press and hold the eject button for 7 seconds, until all LEDs become active, and then release the button. The Ready LED will continue flashing, the Fault LED will remain on, and a 1 is displayed in the Single-character display (SCD). This combination indicates that the drive is waiting for a cartridge to be inserted. Start the self-test by inserting a blank, Ultrium 5 data cartridge into the drive.  If an Ultrium-5 data cartridge is not available, an Ultrium-4 cartridge can be substituted.  A cartridge must be loaded within 15 seconds or the drive will automatically revert back to normal operation.  If necessary, return to step 1 to reenter diagnostic mode. The test takes about 4 minutes. Use a cartridge that is not write-protected.  If a write-protected cartridge is inserted while the drive is in diagnostic mode, the cartridge will be ejected. See . Self-testing can only be performed using a write-compatible (either Ultrium-4 or Ultrium-3) cartridge type, and with a cartridge that is not damaged. See . If a cleaning cartridge is inserted while the drive is in diagnostic mode, it will be ejected. While self-testing is in progress, the LEDs will remain active and the following test steps are performed:  The hardware test runs for about one minute. During that time, a static test is performed on the electrical components of the drive, and proper operation of the cartridge load/unload mechanism is verified.   The write/read test runs for about three minutes.  Interpreting the resultsResult Description Test passed When self-testing has completed successfully and no problems were detected, the cartridge is unloaded from the drive and all LEDs are off.  Proper function of both the drive and tape cartridge have been verified. The drive is no longer in diagnostic mode, and has been returned to normal operation.  If the yellow Fault LED remains on and a C is displayed in the SCD, this combination indicates that self-testing has completed successfully but that cleaning is required.  Drive failure When a drive problem is detected, the cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, the yellow Fault LED flashes, and a 5 is displayed in the SCD. Replace the tape drive. Media failure When a media problem is detected, the cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, the yellow Fault LED remains on, and a 7 is displayed in the SCD. Repeat the self-test using another blank tape cartridge and discard the defective media.   Incorrect cartridge When an incorrect tape cartridge is used for the test, the cartridge is unloaded, the yellow Fault LED remains on, and a P, 7, or J is displayed in the SCD.  This can happen if the cartridge is:Write-protected (P is displayed in the SCD.) Damaged (7 is displayed in the SCD.) Not write-compatible with the drive (J is displayed in the SCD.) Press the eject button to end the self-test and return the drive to normal operating mode.  Then return to step 1 and run the self-test again using a suitable cartridge. Returning to normal operationWhen self-testing has completed successfully, the tape cartridge is unloaded. The drive is no longer in diagnostic mode and returns to normal operation. When self-testing fails, the tape cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, and the drive remains in diagnostic mode. Press the eject button to unload tape cartridge and return drive to normal operation. Parent topic:

 Eject button functions on the tape drive (FC EU11) You might need to eject a tape, reset the drive, or place the drive in maintenance mode. Use the information in this topic to perform these tasks. The drive has an eject button that enables you to perform the functions shown in the following table. The eject button is illustrated in . Function How to start the function Reset the drive Press and hold the Unload Button until the drive begins the reset procedure, at which the status light will turn amber. If a tape cartridge is loaded in the drive, the drive unloads the tape. Repeat the reset procedure after the tape is unloaded. The drive saves a dump of the current drive state, and then reboots to allow communication. Do not cycle power because this action erases the contents of the dump. Rewind the tape into the cartridge and eject the cartridge from the tape drive Press the Unload Button once. The status light flashes green while the drive is rewinding and unloading. During a rewind and eject operation, the drive does not accept SCSI commands from the server. Place the tape drive in maintenance mode Ensure that the drive is unloaded. Then, press and hold the Unload Button for 6 seconds. The drive is in maintenance mode when the status light becomes solid amber and 0 is shown in the SCD. While in maintenance mode, the drive does not accept SCSI commands. If you attempt to enter maintenance mode with a cartridge in the drive, the drive will rewind and eject the cartridge. Remove the cartridge and repeat the steps for entering maintenance mode. Scroll through the maintenance functions While in maintenance mode, press the Unload Button once per second to increment the display characters by one. When you reach the character of the diagnostic or maintenance function that you want (see ), press and hold the Unload Button for three seconds. Exit maintenance mode Press the Unload Button once per second until 0 is displayed. Then press and hold the Unload Button for three seconds. After the status sight becomes solid green and the SCD becomes blank, the drive exits the maintenance mode. Force a drive dump (The function is part of the maintenance mode.)  If the drive detects a permanent error and displays an error code, it automatically forces a drive dump (also known as saving the firmware trace). If you force a drive dump, the existing dump is overwritten and data is lost. After you force a drive dump, do not turn off the power to the drive or you might lose the dump data. Choose one of the following procedures:If the drive is in maintenance mode (that is, the status light is solid amber), see  to view the available maintenance functions. If the drive is in operating mode (that is, status light is solid or flashing green), press and hold the Unload Button for 10 seconds. If captured dump data exists, the drive places it into a dump area. Parent topic:          
 Status lights (FC EU11) Two status light-emitting diode (LED) lights and their ISO symbols are located on the drive as shown in the following figure:  Index Description Eject button Ready LED Encrypt LED Fault LED Single-character display (SCD) SCD light  The preventative maintenance cleaning frequency is approximately 100 tape motion hours or when the drive indicates that cleaning is required. Tape motion hours are defined as the time the tape drive is moving tape. When a fault occurs, the drive causes AIX to log an information error (TAPE_ERR6) in the AIX log, indicating that the tape drive needs to be cleaned. Use only IBM media. IBM only supports the use of IBM media and IBM cleaning cartridges. When the tape drive indicates that the drive needs to be cleaned, it is the customer's responsibility to clean the tape drive with the recommended cleaning cartridge.

 Cleaning the tape drive (FC EU11) Clean the LTO-6 tape drive whenever C is displayed on the single-character display and the status light is flashing amber once per second or when a system I/O error related to the device occurs. Do not clean the drive head on a periodic basis. Only clean the drive head when the drive requests. The LTO-6 tape drive monitors the amount of time between cleaning operations and displays the C when required. Use only the recommended cleaning cartridge to clean the tape drive. Use of other than the recommended cleaning cartridges can damage your drive and might void the warranty.  In maintenance mode, a flashing C with the solid amber fault LED indicates that a cartridge must be inserted. This error code does not indicate that the drive head requires cleaning. To clean the LTO tape drive, complete the following steps:   The IBM cleaning cartridge is designed to be used for 50 cleanings. After a cleaning cartridge has been used to its maximum number of uses, the cartridge is considered expired. When the cleaning cartridge has been used 50 times, discard the cleaning cartridge. The LTO tape drive detects and automatically ejects an expired cartridge. Use of the cleaning cartridge for more than 50 times can cause debris to be deposited on the drive head, which might result in errors or inferior data quality. After the cleaning cartridge has been inserted, the remainder of the cleaning process is automatic. The tape drive completes the following actions: Loads the cleaning cartridge into the tape drive. Cleans the drive by using the cleaning tape. Cleaning time might take from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on the number of times that the cleaning cartridge has been used. Unloads the cleaning cartridge when the cleaning operation is completed.  If the cleaning operation is completed but the C in the SCD remains on, the cleaning cartridge might not be usable. Repeat the cleaning procedure with a new cleaning cartridge. If the C in the SCD still remains on, contact your authorized service provider. To determine how many times a cleaning cartridge can be used, check the information printed on the cartridge. If you attempt to use a depleted cleaning cartridge, the fault indicator is turned on and the SCD displays 6 or 7 to indicate that the cleaning process was not done and that the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. If the fault indicator was lit and a C was shown in the SCD prior to the cleaning process, the indicators stay on after the depleted cleaning cartridge is removed. If these indicators were off prior to inserting the depleted cleaning cartridge, they will turn off after the depleted cleaning cartridge is removed from the drive. If a system error occurs, clean the drive and retry the operation. If the operation fails, replace the data cartridge, clean the drive again, and then retry the operation. Parent topic:

Maintenance functions Display code Normal mode  None Maintenance mode  0 Run drive diagnostics  1 Update the drive firmware from the field microcode replacement (FMR) tape 2 Create the FMR tape  3 Force a drive dump (same as pressing the eject button for 10 or more seconds, except it does not cause a reset operation) 4 Copy the drive dump to tape at the beginning of tape 5 Copy the drive dump to tape  5-1 Copy the drive dump to flash memory  5-8 Clear the flash dump  5-3 No function 5 -0 Run the host interface wrap test 6 Test the primary SAS port  6-1 Test the secondary SAS port 6-8 Test both the primary and secondary SAS ports at the same time (requires a wrap plug in both ports) 6-3 Exit 6-0 Run the RS-422 wrap test 7 Unmake the FMR tape 8 Display the error code log  9 Clear the error code log  A Insert the tape cartridge into the tape drive  C Test the tape cartridge and the media  E Write a performance test F Test the head  H Fast read/write test  J Load/unload test L Enable posterror reporting P Disable posterror reporting U Running a maintenance functionTo run the maintenance function indicated by the character on the single-character display, press and hold the eject button for 2 seconds.  The single digit flashes the selected maintenance function code during the running of the operation.  If the drive runs the function successfully, the single-character display indicates 0.  If the function fails, the status LED indicates continuous yellow and the single-character display indicates the reason for the error by displaying an error code. For more information, see . Exiting maintenance modeThe drive must be in maintenance mode to run drive diagnostics or maintenance functions. To exit maintenance mode, complete the following steps: Press and hold the Unload button for 3 or more seconds, and then release the button to take the drive out of maintenance mode. If no error is detected, 0 is shown temporarily in the SCD, and then the SCD goes blank. The drive then exits maintenance mode and the status light returns to green. If an error is detected, the SCD shows an error code but still exits maintenance mode. To clear the error, turn the drive off and then on again.  The drive also automatically exits maintenance mode after it completes a maintenance function or after 10 minutes if no action has occurred. Running a dump operation when not in maintenance mode To perform a drive dump operation, press and hold the eject button for 10 or more seconds.  The microcode goes to its initialized state after a dump operation.  Data from a dump operation is for use by trained personnel for problem determination. Parent topic:          
 Performing the internal self-test (FC EU11) Use the information in this topic to perform an internal self-test on your tape drive. Use this procedure to quickly perform a complete set of diagnostic tests on your LTO-6 tape drive, without impacting server operation.  This 4-minute test can also be used to verify good performance of individual LTO tape cartridges. For an illustration of the tape drive and the LED status lights that are referred to in this procedure, see . PrerequisitesTo perform the test, you need a blank LTO-6 (Ultrium 6) data cartridge. If an Ultrium-6 data cartridge is not available, an Ultrium-5 cartridge can be substituted. Performing the test Use a blank data cartridge to perform the test. During the test, the tape is overwritten with a test pattern and all data on the tape is destroyed. To perform the test, complete the following steps:Enter diagnostic mode by completing the following substeps:Verify that a tape cartridge is not loaded in the drive. To unload a cartridge, press the eject button on the front of the drive.  Press and hold the eject button for 7 seconds, until all LEDs become active, and then release the button. The Ready LED continues to flash, the fault LED remains on, and a 1 is displayed in the single-character display (SCD). This combination indicates that the drive is waiting for a cartridge to be inserted. Start the self-test by inserting a blank, Ultrium 6 data cartridge into the drive.  If an Ultrium-6 data cartridge is not available, an Ultrium-5 cartridge can be substituted.  A cartridge must be loaded within 15 seconds or the drive automatically reverts back to normal operation.  If necessary, return to  to reenter into diagnostic mode. The test takes about 4 minutes. Use a cartridge that is not write-protected.  If a write protected cartridge is inserted while the drive is in diagnostic mode, the cartridge will be ejected. See . Self-testing can only be performed by using a write-compatible cartridge type (either Ultrium-6 or Ultrium-5), and with a cartridge that is not damaged. See . If a cleaning cartridge is inserted while the drive is in diagnostic mode, it will be ejected. While self-testing is in progress, the LEDs remain active and the following test steps are performed:  The hardware test runs for about 1 minute. During that time, a static test is performed on the electrical components of the drive, and proper operation of the cartridge load/unload mechanism is verified. The write/read test runs for about 3 minutes. Interpreting the resultsResult Description Test passed When self-testing completes successfully and no problems are detected, the cartridge is unloaded from the drive and all LEDs are off. Proper functioning of both the drive and tape cartridge have been verified. The drive is no longer in diagnostic mode, and it returns to normal operation.  If the yellow fault LED remains on and a C is displayed in the SCD, this combination indicates that self-testing has completed successfully but that cleaning is required.  Drive failure When a drive problem is detected, the cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, the yellow fault LED flashes, and a 5 is displayed in the SCD. Replace the tape drive. Media failure When a media problem is detected, the cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, the yellow fault LED remains on, and a 7 is displayed in the SCD. Repeat the self-test using another blank tape cartridge and discard the defective media.   Incorrect cartridge When an incorrect tape cartridge is used for the test, the cartridge is unloaded, the yellow fault LED remains on, and a P, 7, or J is displayed in the SCD. These characters are displayed for the following reasons:The cartridge is write-protected (P is displayed in the SCD.) The cartridge is damaged (7 is displayed in the SCD.) The cartridge is not write-compatible with the drive (J is displayed in the SCD.) Press the eject button to end the self-test and return the drive to normal operating mode.  Then, return to  and run the self-test again using a suitable cartridge. Returning to normal operationWhen self-testing has completed successfully, the tape cartridge is unloaded. The drive is no longer in diagnostic mode, and it returns to normal operation. When self-testing fails, the tape cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, and the drive remains in diagnostic mode. Press the eject button to unload tape cartridge and to return drive to normal operation. Parent topic:

The tape drive will turn on the cleaning indicator for the The tape drive exceeds internal preset error thresholds in the drive.  A cleaning cartridge that has been used the maximum number of times is inserted in the drive. The cleaning indicator is turned on to indicate that the cleaning process was not done and the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. The tape drive exceeds the maximum recommended time between cleaning. The maximum recommended time between preventive-maintenance cleaning is 50 tape motion hours. Tape motion hours are defined as the time that the tape drive is moving tape. If the tape drive reaches 50 tape motion hours since the tape drives was last cleaned, the drive will turn on the cleaning required LED to  indicate the drive needs cleaning.  The tape drive will continue to operate but the tape drive should be cleaned at the next opportunity to insert a cleaning cartridge. To clean the tape drive, complete the following steps:   Some cleaning cartridges have white dots on the window side that are designed to be used to log the use of the cartridge. Each time the cartridge is used, mark one of the dots on the cartridge with a pen or marker. When all of the dots have been marked, discard the cleaning cartridge. After the cleaning cartridge has been inserted, the remainder of the cleaning process is automatic. The tape drive does the following actions: Loads the cleaning cartridge into the tape drive. Cleans the drive by moving the cleaning tape forward for approximately 30 seconds. Unloads the cleaning cartridge when the cleaning operation is complete. Indicates a successful cleaning operation by turning off the Fault status light (if the Fault light was on prior to the cleaning process.  If the cleaning operation completes but the Fault light remains on, repeat the cleaning procedure with a new cleaning cartridge. If the light still remains on, contact your authorized service provider. To determine how many times a cleaning cartridge can be used, check the information printed on the cartridge. If you attempt to use a depleted cleaning cartridge, the tape drive automatically detects the error and ejects the cartridge. If the Fault status light was on prior to the cleaning process, it stays on; if the Fault light was off, the depleted cartridge causes the light to come on. If a system error occurs, clean the drive and retry the operation. If the operation fails, replace the data cartridge, clean the drive again, then retry the operation. Parent topic:

 Performing the internal self-test (FC 5746) Use the information in this section to perform an internal self-test on your tape drive. This procedure is designed to allow you to quickly perform a complete set of diagnostic tests on your LTO-4 tape drive, without impacting server operation.  This 4-minute test can also be used to verify good performance of individual LTO tape cartridges. For an illustration of the tape drive and the LED status lights that are referred to in this procedure, see  PrerequisitesIn order to perform the test you need a blank LTO-4 (Ultrium 4) data cartridge. If an Ultrium-4 data cartridge is not available, an Ultrium-3 cartridge can be substituted. Performing the testFollow these steps to perform the test: Use a blank data cartridge to perform the test. During the test, the tape will be overwritten with a test pattern and all data on the tape will be destroyed. Enter diagnostic mode by doing the following steps:Verify that a tape cartridge is not loaded in the drive. To unload a cartridge, press the eject button on the front of the drive.  Press and hold the eject button for 7 seconds, until all LEDs become active, and then release the button. The Ready LED will continue flashing, the Fault LED will remain on, and a 1 is displayed in the Single-character display (SCD). This combination indicates that the drive is waiting for a cartridge to be inserted. Start the self-test by inserting a blank, Ultrium 4 data cartridge into the drive.  If an Ultrium-4 data cartridge is not available, an Ultrium-3 cartridge can be substituted.   A cartridge must be loaded within 15 seconds or the drive will automatically revert back to normal operation.  If necessary, return to step 1 to reenter diagnostic mode. The test takes about 4 minutes. Use a cartridge that is not write-protected.  If a write-protected cartridge is inserted while the drive is in diagnostic mode, the cartridge will be ejected. See . Self-testing can only be performed using a write-compatible (either Ultrium-4 or Ultrium-3) cartridge type, and with a cartridge that is not damaged. See . If a cleaning cartridge is inserted while the drive is in diagnostic mode, it will be ejected. While self-testing is in progress, the LEDs will remain active and the following test steps are performed:  The hardware test runs for about one minute. During that time, a static test is performed on the electrical components of the drive, and proper operation of the cartridge load/unload mechanism is verified.   The write/read test runs for about three minutes.  Interpreting the resultsResult Description Test passed When self-testing has completed successfully and no problems were detected, the cartridge is unloaded from the drive and all LEDs are off.  Proper function of both the drive and tape cartridge have been verified. The drive is no longer in diagnostic mode, and has been returned to normal operation.  If the yellow Fault LED remains on and a C is displayed in the SCD, this combination indicates that self-testing has completed successfully but that cleaning is required.  Drive failure When a drive problem is detected, the cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, the yellow Fault LED flashes, and a 5 is displayed in the SCD.  Replace the tape drive. Media failure When a media problem is detected, the cartridge remains loaded inside the drive, the yellow Fault LED remains on, and a 7 is displayed in the SCD. Repeat the self-test using another blank tape cartridge and discard the defective media.   Incorrect cartridge When an incorrect tape cartridge is used for the test, the cartridge is unloaded, the yellow Fault LED remains on, and a P, 7, or J is displayed in the SCD.  This can happen if the cartridge is:Write-protected (P is displayed in the SCD.) Damaged (7 is displayed in the SCD.) Not write-compatible with the drive (J is displayed in the SCD.) Press the eject button to end the self-test and return the drive to normal operating mode.  Then return to step 1 and run the self-test again using a suitable cartridge.

 Cleaning the tape drive (FC 5755) Clean the device whenever the Fault status light comes on or a system I/O error related to the device occurs. Use only the recommended cleaning cartridge to clean the tape drive. Use of other than recommended cleaning cartridges can damage your drive and might void the warranty. The tape drive will turn on the cleaning indication for several reasons: - The tape drive exceeds internal preset error thresholds in the drive.  - A cleaning cartridge that has been used the maximum number of times is inserted in the drive. The cleaning indicator is turned on to indicate that the cleaning process was not done and the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable.  The tape drive exceeds the maximum recommended time between cleaning.   The maximum recommended time between preventive-maintenance cleaning is 100 tape motion hours. Tape motion hours are defined as the time that the tape drive is moving tape.  If the tape drive reaches 100 tape motion hours since the tape drive was last cleaned, the drive will turn on the cleaning required LED to indicate the drive needs cleaning.  The tape drive will continue to operate but it is recommended the tape drive be cleaned at the next opportunity to insert a cleaning cartridge. To clean the tape drive, complete the following steps:   After the cleaning cartridge has been inserted, the remainder of the cleaning process is automatic. The tape drive does the following actions: Loads the cleaning cartridge into the tape drive. Cleans the drive by moving the cleaning tape forward for approximately 30 seconds. Unloads the cleaning cartridge when the cleaning operation is complete. Indicates a successful cleaning operation by turning off the Cleaning status light (if the Cleaning light was on prior to the cleaning process. Otherwise, the Cleaning light remains solid to indicate that the cleaning cartridge is no longer usable. Obtain a new cleaning cartridge and repeat the process.) If the cleaning operation completes but the Cleaning light remains on, repeat the cleaning procedure with a new cleaning cartridge. If the light still remain on, contact your authorized service representative. To determine how many times a cleaning cartridge may be used, check the information printed on the cartridge. If you attempt to use a depleted cleaning cartridge, the drive automatically detects the error and ejects the cartridge. If the Cleaning status light was on prior to the cleaning process, it stays on; if the Cleaning light was off, the depleted cartridge causes the light to come on. If a system error occurs, clean the drive and retry the operation. If the operation fails, replace the data cartridge, clean the drive again, then retry the operation. Parent topic:

 Handling and storing the DVD media Learn how to handle and store the DVD media.  DVD media must be handled with care. Leaving the media exposed allows dirt particles to accumulate and to become a source of contamination. Handling the DVD media with care reduces errors and improves the performance. Restrictions on using DVD mediaCorrect ways to handle DVD media: Handle media by the outer edge or the center hole. Store media in jewel cases specified for DVDs. Return media to storage cases immediately after use to minimize the effects of environmental changes. Store media in a cool, dry environment in which the air is clean. Remove dirt, foreign materials, fingerprints, smudges, and liquids by wiping with a clean cotton fabric in a straight line from the center of the disc toward the outer edge. Check the media surface before recording. Incorrect ways to handle DVD media: Touch the surface of the media. Bend the media. Use adhesive labels on the media. Expose media to extreme heat or high humidity. Expose media to prolonged sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet light. Write or mark in the data area of the media. Clean by wiping in a circular direction going around the disc. Parent topic:  Parent topic:

 7036-P16 description and overview Learn about the product description, characteristics, and throughput considerations for this device. Product description The 7036-P16 is a 16-port EIA-232 LAN-Attached Remote Asynchronous Node (RAN) for PowerÂ® Systems servers. The 7036-P16 provides connectivity to asynchronous EIA-232 devices, such as modems, terminal type (tty) terminals, printers, and so on. The 7036-P16 can be used in a rack-mounted or table-top configuration. Hardware to mount the 7036-P16 in a rack or to use on a table top is included in the package. When installed in a rack, take care with routing the cables to ensure the cables do not interfere with other devices mounted in the rack. The 7036-P16, when used with Digi RealPort software, will convert the serial data stream to and from attached asynchronous EIA-232 devices into TCP/IP traffic. After the data is on the TCP/IP network, a host system attached to the same network can treat the attached devices as if the devices were connected directly to the host system. Product characteristicsSafety:UL CD certified to EN60950 3rd Edition CSA C22.2 No 60950 UL recognized to UL60950 3rd Edition Physical characteristics:Physical Dimensions: (16.8in./42.7cm)x(6.6in./16.76cm)x(1.6in./4.06cm) Weight: 7.05 lb./3.2 kg  Environmental Limits:Operating Temperature: 0 - 40 C (ambient air temperature)  Humidity: 5 - 95% (noncondensing)  Wet Bulb: 29 C Altitude: 0 - 7000 ft  Storage Temperature: 1 - 60 C Humidity: 5 - 80% (non-condensing)  Wet Bulb: 29 C Shipping  Temperature: -40 to 60 C  Humidity: 5 - 100% (non-condensing)  Wet Bulb: 29 C Power Consumption Voltage (input) Current (amp)  Watt 100 - 250 VAC nominal 0.8 A Maximum 12 W typical         90 - 264 VAC maximum     40A in rush Â   47/63 Hz  2A fuse Â  Throughput considerationsThe limits on throughput are a function of the network and the server or server partition to which the 7036-P16 ports are configured. System port throughput: The 7036-P16 supports full-duplex operation up to 230 kbps on all ports. Operation with all 16 ports running full-duplex at 230 kbps is supported. Network throughput: The 7036-P16 is an Ethernet attached device and as such, any number may be attached to a given network. However, attaching more devices to any network reduces the overall network throughput and care must be taken to not overload any given network. Testing has shown that as many as eight 7036-P16 devices may be attached to a network without adversely affecting network throughput. Eight 7036-P16 devices will support up to 128 asynchronous EIA-232 connections. More devices may be attached, but network performance may be adversely affected. Server or partition throughput: Each 7036-P16 provides 16-Ports of asynchronous EIA-232 connectivity over a 10/100 Ethernet port at speeds up to 230 kbps. Given that any number of 7036-P16s may be attached to a server or partition, a single server or partition could in effect have a very large number of asynchronous EIA-232 connections that could adversely affect any single server or partition.

 Configuring the 7036-P16 into the network You might need to configure the 7036-P16 device to work within the system network. Use the procedure in this section to perform this task. The following sections describe methods for configuring the 7036-P16 in a network: the Ethernet method, the ping-ARP method, and the direct-terminal attach method. Network configuration methods and considerationsThe 7036-P16 is an Ethernet device and as such it must be configured onto the network like any other Ethernet device. Various network configuration methods are available to the user. Configuring the 7036-P16 onto an Ethernet network If the 7036-P16 is to be used in a network that supports Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), then the configuration will be performed by simply connecting to the network and powering up the 7036-P16. The 7036-P16 is shipped from the factory with the DHCP option enabled. If DHCP is not supported on the network, then the user must choose between the ping-ARP configuration or the direct terminal attach method. The ping-ARP configuration method is recommended for the following reasons:This method does not require the user to be in the same room as the 7036-P16. This method does not require any extra hardware, such as a terminal type (tty) terminal or cabling to attach the 7036-P16 to the tty terminal. This method works equally well for AIXÂ® and Linux installations. This method does not require the 7036-P16 be connected into a network that supports DHCP. Ping-ARP network configuration methodTo configure the 7036-P16 device into the network using this method, do the following steps: Gather the following information from the system or network administrator:MAC Address: [MAC Address] (MAC Address label is on the back of the 7036-P16)  IP Address: [IP Address]  Default Gateway: [IP Gateway Address]  Name Server: [Name Server Address]  Subnet Mask: [Subnet mask] Host Name: [Host Name] Domain Name: [Domain Name] Connect the power cord from the 7036-P16 to a power source and turn the power on. Connect the Ethernet cable from the 7036-P16 to an Ethernet network. Log in to a server as root user, and make sure the server is on the same subnet as the 7036-P16. Manually update the server's ARP table. Use the IP address and the 7036-P16's MAC address gathered in Step 1.The AIX and the Linux command line entries to update the ARP table are different, use the following examples on how to update the server's ARP table:AIX Command: arp -s ether [IP Address] [MAC Address] Linux Command: arp -v -H ether -s [IP Address] [MAC Address] Ping the 7036-P16 using the IP address by typing: ping -c 1 [IP Address] The ping may time out before there is a response from the 7036-P16. Repeat the ping until the 7036-P16 responds. The ping response indicates that the IP address has been configured. Use telnet to access the 7036-P16, using the IP address from the ping command: telnet [IP Address] Log in to the 7036-P16 as root. Use the default password: dbps After logging in, you can change the root password. To change the password, type: newpass Follow the prompts provided after entering the command. To view the current configuration, type: set config Type the following commands on the 7036-P16 command line using the information gathered in Step 1 to complete the IP Address configuration:       set config ip=[IP Address]        set config submask=[Subnet Mask]        set config gateway=[IP Gateway Address]        set config dns=[Name Server Address]        set config dhcp=off        set config hostname=[Host Name]        set config domain=[Domain Name]  As a precaution, you can deactivate the ping-ARP and RARP options. To deactivate the ping-ARP and RARP options type the following commands: set config Ping-ARP=off set config RARP=off          If the user plans to use the Digi RealPort software on the host server to control all the 7036-P16 ports, then the system ports must be configured for use with the Digi RealPort software. Type the following command:  set port range=* dev=rp Issue the reboot command to the 7036-P16 in order to permanently set the changes. Type the following command: boot action=reset When the 7036-P16 reboots, then the network configuration is complete.  The 7036-P16 can now be accessed through the Ethernet connection. The user can program other features as required. See additional documentation on the 7036-P16 Software and Documentation CD. Direct-attach configuration method A regular tty terminal or a PC running a terminal emulation program, may be attached directly to any one of the 16 ports and commands entered on the 7036-P16 command line to configure the 7036-P16 onto the network. This method requires the user to be in the same room as the 7036-P16. This method requires the user to have a tty terminal or a PC available. This method requires a serial cable to connect the tty terminal or PC to the server. This method is independent of the operating system installed on the server. To configure the 7036-P16 device into the network using this method, do the following steps: Gather the following information from the system or network administrator:MAC Address: [MAC Address] (MAC Address label is on the back of the 7036-P16) IP Address: [IP Address] Default Gateway: [IP Gateway Address] Name Server: [Name Server Address] Subnet Mask: [Subnet mask] Host Name: [Host Name] Domain Name: [Domain Name] Connect the power cord from the 7036-P16 to a power source and power up. Connect the serial cable from tty terminal to the 7036-P16. Log in to the 7036-P16 as the root user, use the default password dbps.  After login, you can change the root password. Type:newpass  To view the current configuration, type: set config Type the following commands on the 7036-P16 command line using the information gathered in Step 1 to complete the IP Address configuration:       set config ip=[IP Address]        set config submask=[Subnet Mask]        set config gateway=[IP Gateway Address]        set config dns=[Name Server Address]        set config dhcp=off        set config hostname=[Host Name]        set config domain=[Domain Name] As a precaution, you can deactivate the Ping-ARP and RARP options. To deactivate the Ping-ARP and RARP options type the following commands: set config Ping-ARP=off set config RARP=off          If you plan to use the Digi RealPort software on the host server to control all the 7036-P16 ports, then the system ports must be configured for use with the Digi RealPort software. Type the following command:  set port range=* dev=rp Issue the reboot command to the 7036-P16 in order to permanently set the changes. Type the following command: boot action=reset When the 7036-P16 reboots, then the network configuration is complete.  The 7036-P16 may now be accessed via the Ethernet connection.

If dual power supplies are installed and operating, the power supplies draw approximately equal current from the utility (electrical supply) and provide approximately equal current to the load. Power draw and heat load vary greatly by configuration.  When planning for an electrical system, it is important to use maximum values.  However, when planning for heat load, you can use the IBM Systems Energy Estimator to obtain a heat output estimate based on a specific configuration.  See  website for more information. Power 720 servers are rated 100 - 127 V ac and 200 - 240 V ac. Power 740 servers are rated at 200 - 240 V ac.

 Planning for HMC installation and configuration This section describes the high-level planning tasks you must perform before you install and configure your HMC.  To plan for HMC installation and configuration, do the following: Ensure that your HMC hardware meets the requirements to manage your server and obtain and install the latest HMC code. Determine the physical location of the HMC in relation to the servers it will manage. If the HMC is more than 7 meters (25 feet) from its managed system, you must provide web browser access to the HMC from the managed system's location so that service personnel can access the HMC. Identify the servers that the HMC will manage. Determine whether you will use a private or an open network to manage servers.  If you will use an open network to manage a Flexible Service Processor (FSP), you must manually set the FSP's address through the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) menus. A private, nonroutable network is recommended. If you have two HMCs, designate a primary and secondary HMC. The primary HMC should be physically closer to the machine, and should be the HMC that is configured to call home. Determine the network settings that you will need to connect the HMC to remote workstations, logical partitions, and network devices.  Define how the HMC will connect to use the call-home function. Call home options include over an outbound-only Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Internet connection, a modem, or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. Determine the HMC users that you will create and their passwords, as well as which roles they will be given. Document the following company contact information that will be needed when you configure call home: Company name Administrator contact E-mail address Telephone numbers Fax numbers The street address of the HMC's physical location If you plan to use e-mail to notify operators or systems administrators when information is sent to  Service through call-home function, identify the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server and the e-mail addresses you will use. Define the following passwords:The access password that will be used to authenticate the HMC to the FSP The ASMI password that will be used for the admin user The ASMI password that will be used for the general user Create the passwords when you connect from the HMC to a new server for the first time.  If the HMC is a redundant or second HMC, obtain the HMC user password and be prepared to enter it when you connect the first time to the managed server's FSP. For detailed information about the planning tasks you should complete before performing a first-time installation, see  .  The  function requires that the Hardware Management Console (HMC) must have at least 2 GB of random access memory (RAM) installed. Install the HMC hardware. To install the HMC into a rack, see . To install a stand-alone HMC, see . Parent topic:  Related tasks:    |      
 Preparing for  configuration Use this section to gather required configuration settings that you need to know before you begin the configuration steps.  To configure the HMC, you must understand the related concepts, make decisions and prepare information. This section describes the information you will need to connect your HMC to the following:Service processors in your managed systems Logical partitions on those managed systems Remote workstations Service, to implement âcall-homeâ functions  Additional connectivity and security information is available. For more information, see   To prepare for HMC configuration, do the following: Obtain and install the latest level of the HMC code version you want to install.  Determine the physical location of the HMC in relation to the servers it will manage. If the HMC is more than 25 feet from its managed system, you must provide web browser access to the HMC from the managed system's location so that service personnel can access the HMC. Identify the servers that the HMC will manage. Determine whether you will use a private or an open network to manage servers.  If you decide to use a private network, use DHCP, unless you are using a Cluster Systems Management (CSM) configuration. CSM does not support IPv6. To access CSM, you must have two networks. For more information about CSM, see the documentation that was provided with that feature. For more information about private and open networks, see . If you will use an open network to manage an FSP, you must set the FSP's address manually through the Advanced System Management Interface menus. A private, non-routable network is recommended. If you have two HMCs, designate a primary and secondary HMC. The primary HMC should be physically closer to the machine, and should be the HMC that is configured to call home. Determine the network settings that you will need to connect the HMC to remote workstations, logical partitions, and network devices.  Define how the HMC will âcall home.â Call home options include either over an outbound-only Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Internet connection, a modem, or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. Determine the HMC users that you will create and their passwords, as well which roles they will be given. You must assign the hscroot and hscpe users a password. Document the following company contact information that will be needed when configuring call home: Company name Administrator contact Email address Telephone numbers Fax numbers The street address of the HMC's physical location If you plan to use email to notify operators or systems administrators when information is sent to IBM Service through call-home, identify the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server and the email addresses you will use. You must define the following passwords:The access password that will be used to authenticate the HMC to the FSP The ASMI password that will be used for the  user The ASMI password that will be used for the  user Create the passwords when you connect from the HMC to a new server for the first time.  If the HMC is a redundant or second HMC, obtain the HMC User password and be prepared to enter it when connecting the first time to the managed server's FSP. When you have completed these preparation steps, complete the . Parent topic:

 Acoustics Acoustic noise emission data allows you to assess noise levels for your data processing equipment. Acoustic noise emission data  is provided for the benefit of installation planners and consultants to help predict acoustical noise levels in data centers and other installations of information technology and telecommunications equipment.  Such noise declarations also allow you to compare noise levels of one product to another and to compare the levels to any applicable specifications. The format of the data provided conforms to ISO 9296: Acoustics - Declared Noise Emission Values of Computer and Business Equipment. The measurement procedures used to acquire the data conform to International Standard ISO 7779 and its American National Standard equivalent ANSI S12.10.  The following terms are used to present acoustical data. LWAd is the declared (upper limit) A-weighted sound power level for a random sample of machines. LpAm is the mean value of the A-weighted sound pressure levels either at the operator position or at the bystander (1-meter) positions for a random sample of machines. <LpA>m is the mean value of the space-averaged sound-pressure-emission levels at the one-meter positions for a random sample of machines. Acoustical treatment of data centers or other rooms, in which the equipment is installed, is recommended to achieve lower noise levels. Lower noise levels tend to enhance employee productivity and avoid mental fatigue, improve communications, reduce employee complaints, and generally improve employee comfort. Proper room design, including the use of acoustical treatment, might require the services of a specialist in acoustics. The total noise level of an installation with information technology and telecommunications equipment is an accumulation of all the noise sources in the room. This level is affected by the physical arrangement of the products on the floor, the sound reflective (or absorptive) characteristics of the room surfaces, and the noise from other data center support equipment such as air conditioning units and backup power equipment. Noise levels might be reduced with proper spacing and orientation of the various noise-emitting equipment. Provide sufficient space around such machines:  the farther apart they can be placed, the lower the overall room noise will be. In smaller installations, such as small offices and general business areas, pay additional attention to the location of equipment relative to the work areas of the employees. At work areas, consider locating personal computers and computer workstations next to the desk rather than on top of it. Small servers should be located as far away from personnel as possible.  Locate nearby work areas away from the exhaust of computer equipment. The use of absorptive materials can reduce the overall noise level in most installations. Effective and economical sound reduction can be achieved by using a sound-absorptive ceiling. The use of acoustically absorbing free-standing barriers can reduce the direct noise, increase room absorption and provide privacy. The use of absorptive material, such as carpeting on the floor, results in further reduction of the sound level in the room. Any carpeting used in a computer room must meet the electrical continuity requirements stated in Static electricity and floor resistance. To prevent computer room noise from reaching adjacent office areas, walls should be constructed from the structural floor to the structural ceiling. Also, ensure that doors and walls are properly sealed. Acoustical treatment of overhead ducts might further reduce noise transmitted to or from other rooms. Many  large systems products are offered with optional acoustical front and rear doors to help attenuate the noise of the product itself. Smaller  products might also offer special acoustical packages. If noise exposure is a concern for the installation planners or employees, inquiries should be made to   on the availability of such product options. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Site preparation and physical planning These guidelines help you prepare your site for the delivery and installation of your server. The selection of a site for information technology equipment is the first consideration in planning and preparing for the installation. Determine whether a new site is to be constructed or alterations are to be performed on an existing site. Define an access route from your loading dock to your data processing area before delivery of your server. Use these guidelines to minimize static electricity buildup in your data center. The floor area required for the equipment is determined by the specific servers to be installed, the location of columns, floor loading capacity, and provisions for future expansion. Calculate the floor loads for your server with these formulas. Learn how a raised floor environment improves data center operational efficiency. Historically, cabling (power or signal) for computer systems has been done within a rack or under a raised floor. There has been growing customer interest in using nonraised floors, requiring some or all of the cabling to be overhead.  Effective computer room layout is dependent on several important factors. Use this information to plan for possible vibration and shock in your data center. Proper lighting is required to normally operate the server and when service is required. Acoustic noise emission data allows you to assess noise levels for your data processing equipment. Use this information to plan for server installation in an environment that has a high electomagnetic-radiated field. Computer room location is affected by several factors. Special safety considerations are required when storing data or other material.  Planning for emergencies ensures that your data center continues to operate in the event of a power outage. Reliable electrical power is required for the proper functioning of your data processing equipment. The air conditioning system must provide year-round temperature and humidity control as a result of the heat dissipated during equipment operation.  Use these environmental design criteria to ensure that your data center environment provides optimal conditions for your server operation. Temperature and humidity recording instruments should be installed to provide a continuous record of the environmental conditions.  Shipment or storage conditions that exceed the specified limits can cause permanent damage to your server. These guidelines should be followed when relocating or temporarily storing your server. Server and storage equipment must be acclimated to the surrounding environment to prevent condensation. Careful attention should be given to the method of air distribution to eliminate areas of excessive air motion and hot spots. Use this information to prepare your location to facilitate the use of the  rear door heat exchanger. Your installation requires a variety of communication equipment to support the computer installation. Telephone lines, fax lines, and the remote support facility (RSF) are just some of the types of communications that you will need to have installed.         
 Site selection The selection of a site for information technology equipment is the first consideration in planning and preparing for the installation. Determine whether a new site is to be constructed or alterations are to be performed on an existing site. This section provides specific information on building location, structure, and space requirements for present and future needs. UtilitiesPower and communication facilities must be available in the quantities required for operation. If these are inadequate, contact the utility company to determine if additional services can be made available.    Exposure to hazardsPollution, flooding, radio or radar interference, and hazards caused by nearby industries can cause problems to information technology equipment and recorded media. Any indication of exposure in these areas should be recognized and included in the planning of the installation. Parent topic:          
 Access Define an access route from your loading dock to your data processing area before delivery of your server. A preliminary check of the building will show if adequate access for the normal delivery of supplies and servers exists. A small alley, a narrow door opening, or limited access to the delivery area can become inhibitive to installation. The loading dock, passageways, and elevators should be able to accommodate heavy, oversized data processing support equipment such as air conditioning equipment. Access routeDefine an access route from the loading dock to the data processing area. A small alley (cannot accommodate delivery truck), a narrow door opening <914 mm (<36 in.), low height 2032 mm (<80 in.), or limited access to the delivery area can become inconvenient during the delivery process. If the heights of the truck bed and the dock surface do not match,  the ramp angle should be such that the machine frame does not bottom out while taking it from the truck bed to the dock surface.  Within your site, ramps from hallways to computer-room floors should conform to the American Disabilities Acts (ADA). The ADA requirement states that the ramp should have a 1:12 relationship. For each inch of vertical height of the raised floor, one foot of ramp length should be provided. As an example, if the raised floor height is 304.8 mm (12 in.), then the ramp length should be 3.66 m (12 ft). The ramps should also be strong enough to support the weight of the server while it is being moved over the surface. The hallways and doors should be wide enough and high enough to allow passage of the server, and ensure adequate turning radius in the hallway. The overhead clearance to pipes and ducts must be sufficient to allow movement of computer equipment, air conditioners, and electrical equipment. Most standard passenger elevators are rated for 1134 kg (2500 lb). Selected information technology equipment, and some site infrastructure equipment such as air conditioning units might exceed 1134 kg (2500 lb). Access to a freight elevator with a minimum rating of 1587 kg (3500 lb) is recommended.  Review the access route from the loading dock to the computer room to prevent problems when moving the frames. Consider making a cardboard template to check the access route for height, width, and length interference. Employ qualified experts if special rigging is required to get the server from the loading dock to the computer room.   Because the dynamic loads of rolling frames are higher than the static loads of stationary frames, floor protection is required at delivery time. It is also important to consider the caster point loads. Some floors cannot withstand the force exerted by the casters of heavier systems. For example, caster point loads on some servers can be as high as 455 kg (1,000 lb). This can penetrate, or otherwise damage, the surface of some floors.  It is also important to protect the raised floor from damage when moving servers or relocating processors in the computer room. Ten mm (3/8 in.) plywood sheeting provides adequate protection. For some of the heavier high-end servers, it is recommended that you use tempered masonite or plyron. Plywood might be too soft for the heavier servers. Delivery and subsequent transportation of the equipment DANGERHeavy equipmentâpersonal injury or equipment damage might result if mishandled. (D006) You must prepare your environment to accept the new product based on the installation planning information provided, with assistance from an  authorized service provider. In anticipation of the equipment delivery, prepare the final installation site in advance so that professional movers or riggers can transport the equipment to the final installation site within the computer room.  If for some reason, this is not possible at the time of delivery, you must make arrangements to have professional movers or riggers return to finish the transportation at a later date. Only professional movers or riggers should transport the equipment. The  authorized service provider can only perform minimal frame repositioning within the computer room, as needed, to perform required service actions.  You are also responsible for using professional movers or riggers when you relocate or dispose of equipment. Parent topic:          
 Static electricity and floor resistance Use these guidelines to minimize static electricity buildup in your data center. Floor covering material can contribute to buildup of high static electrical charges as a result of the motion of people, carts, and furniture in contact with the floor material. Abrupt discharge of the static charges causes discomfort to personnel and might cause malfunction of electronic equipment. Static buildup and discharge can be minimized by: Maintaining the relative humidity of the room within the server operating limits. Choose a control point that normally keeps the humidity between 35 percent and 60 percent. See the Air conditioning determination for further guidance. Providing a conductive path to ground from a metallic raised floor structure including the metal panels. Grounding the raised floor metallic support structure (stringer, pedestals) to building steel at several places within the room. The number of ground points is based on the size of the room. The larger the room, the more ground points are required. Ensuring the maximum resistance for the flooring system is 2 x 1010 ohms, measured between the floor surface and the building (or an applicable ground reference). Flooring material with a lower resistance will further decrease static buildup and discharge. For safety, the floor covering and flooring system should provide a resistance of no less than 150 kilohms when measured between any two points on the floor space 1 m (3 ft) apart. Maintenance of antistatic floor coverings (carpet and tile) should be in agreement with the individual supplier's recommendations. Carpeted floor coverings must meet electrical conductivity requirements. Use only antistatic materials with low-propensity ratings. Using ESD-resistant furniture with conductive casters to prevent static buildup. Measuring floor resistanceThe following equipment is required for measuring floor resistance:     A test instrument similar to an AEMC-1000 megohmmeter is required for measuring floor conductivity. The following figure shows the typical test connection to measure floor conductivity. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Air conditioning determination The air conditioning system must provide year-round temperature and humidity control as a result of the heat dissipated during equipment operation.  Heat dissipation ratings are given in the server specifications for each server. Air conditioning units should not be powered from the computer power panel because of the high starting current drawn by their compressor units. The feeder line for the air conditioning system and the computer room power should not be in the same conduit.    Consider the following factors when determining the air conditioning capacity necessary for installation:               Information technology equipment heat dissipation Number of personnel Lighting requirements Amount of fresh air introduced Possible reheating of circulated air Heat conduction through outer walls and windows  Ceiling height Area of floors Number and placement of door openings Number and height of partitions Most servers are air-cooled by internal blowers. A separate air conditioning system is recommended for data processing installation. A separate system might be required for small systems or individual servers intended for operation when the building air conditioning system is not adequate or is not operational. Server heat dissipation loads are given on the server specifications for each server. See the environmental requirements in the server specifications for your server.  Use these general guidelines to set up your data center. Parent topic:  Related information:         
 General guidelines for data centers Use these general guidelines to set up your data center. Refer to the latest ASHRAE publication, "Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments", dated January, 2004. This document can be purchased online at ashrae.org. A dedicated section outlines a detailed procedure for assessing the overall cooling health of the data center and optimizing for maximum cooling.   Server and storage considerationsMost  servers and storage products are designed to pull chilled air through the front of the server and exhaust hot air out of the back.  The most important requirement is to ensure that the inlet air temperature to the front of the equipment does not exceed  environmental specifications.  See the environmental requirements in the server specifications or hardware specification sheets.  Make sure that the air inlet and exit areas are not blocked by paper, cables, or other obstructions.  When upgrading or repairing your server, be sure not to exceed, if specified, the maximum allowed time for having the cover removed with the unit running.  After your work is completed, be sure to reinstall all fans, heat sinks, air baffles, and other devices per documentation. 	  Manufacturers are reporting heat loads in a format suggested by the ASHRAE publication, "Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments", dated January, 2004.  Although this data is meant to be used to for heat load balancing, care is required when using the data to balance cooling supply and demand as many applications are transient and do not dissipate constant rates of heat.  A thorough understanding of how the equipment and application behave with regard to heat load, including considerations for future growth, is required.   Rack or cabinet considerations Racks are used throughout this section to also mean cabinets, frames, and any other commonly used term to identify the unit that houses rack-mounted equipment.  19-inch racks are designed to allow maximum airflow through the equipment installed in the rack.  Chilled air is pulled through the front and exhausted through the rear by the fans in the rack-mounted equipment.  Most  racks come with a perforated rear door and an optional front door that is perforated.  Some racks have optional acoustical treatment to reduce the noise emissions from the rack.  If  racks are used, solid doors or doors with significant amounts of decorative glass are not recommended as these will not allow sufficient air to flow into and out of the rack.   Recirculation of hot air exiting the back of the rack into the front of the rack must be eliminated.  There are two actions that can be taken to prevent air recirculation.  First, filler or blanking panels must fill all unoccupied rack space that is not occupied by equipment shipped in rack.  1U and 3U filler panels are used to block air recirculation within the rack.  If you do not have filler panels installed in your rack, these are available from .

See the clearance requirements in the server specifications or hardware specification sheets.  The floor layout should not allow the hot air exhaust from the back of one rack to enter the front air inlet of another rack.   Finally, proper cable management is another important element of maximizing the airflow through the rack. Cables must be routed and tied down in such a way that they do not impede the movement of air into or out of the rack.  Such impedance could significantly reduce the volumetric flow of air through the equipment.   Use a fan-assisted rack or cabinet with caution.  Depending upon how much equipment is installed in the cabinet, the air movers in the cabinet may limit the amount of flow to less than what is required by the equipment. Room considerationsData centers designed and built in the last 10 years are typically capable of cooling up to 3KW of heat load per cabinet.  These designs often involve raised floor air distribution plenums 18 to 24 inches in height, room ceiling heights of 8 to 9 feet, and Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units distributed around the perimeter of the room.  IT equipment occupies roughly 30-35% of the total data center space.  The remaining space is white space (for example, access aisles, service clearances), power distribution units (PDUs), and CRAC units. Until recently, little attention has been given to heat load assessments, equipment layout and air delivery paths, heat load distribution, and floor tile placement and openings.   Assessing the total heat load of your installationA total heat load assessment should be conducted to determine your overall environment balance point.  The purpose of the assessment is to see if you have enough sensible cooling, including redundancy, to handle the heat load that you plan to install or have installed.  There are several ways to perform this assessment, but the most common is to review the heat load and cooling in logical sections defined by I-beams, airflow blockages, or CRAC unit locations.   Equipment layout and air delivery pathsThe hot-aisle, cold-aisle arrangement that is explained in the ASHRAE publication, "Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments", dated January, 2004, should be used. In the following figure, racks within the data center are arranged such that there are cold aisles and hot aisles.  The cold aisle consists of perforated floor tiles separating two rows of racks.  The chilled air from the perforated floor tiles is exhausted from the tiles and is drawn into the fronts of the racks.  The inlets of each rack (front of each rack) face the cold aisle.  This arrangement allows the hot air exhausting the rear of the racks to return to the CRAC units; thus, minimizing hot exhaust air from the rack circulating back into the inlets of the racks.  CRAC units are placed at the end of the hot aisles to facilitate the return of the hot air to the CRAC unit and maximize static pressure to the cold aisle. The key to heat load management of the data center is to provide inlet air temperatures to the rack that meet the manufacturer's specifications.  Because the chilled air exhausting from the perforated tiles in the cold aisle may not satisfy the total chilled airflow required by the rack, additional flow will be drawn from other areas of the raised floor and may not be chilled.  See the following figure.  In many cases, the airflow drawn into the top of the rack, after the bottom of the rack has been satisfied, will be a mixture of hot air from the rear of the system and air from other areas.   For those racks that are at the ends of a row, the hot airflow that exhausts from the rear of the rack and migrate to the front around the sides of the rack.  These flow patterns have been observed in actual data centers and in flow modeling. For a data center that may not have the best chilled-air-flow distribution, the following figure gives guidance in providing adequate chilled airflow given a specific heat load.  The chart takes into account worst-case locations in a data center and are the requirements to meet the maximum temperature specifications required by most high-end equipment. Altitude corrections are noted on the bottom portion of the chart. The most common methods for delivering supply air to the racks can be found in System air distribution. Heat load distributionIncreased performance capabilities and the accompanying heat load demands have caused data centers to have hot spots in the vicinity of heat loads that exceed 3KW.  Facility owners are discovering that it is becoming increasingly difficult to plan cooling schemes for large-scale deployments of high-heat-load equipment.  Essentially, two different approaches can be undertaken for a large-scale, high-end server or storage deployment:   Provide ample cooling for maximum heat load requirements across the entire data center. Provide an average amount of cooling across the data center with the capability to increase cooling in limited, local areas. Option 1 is very expensive and more conducive to new construction.  For option 2, a number of things can be done to optimize cooling in existing data centers and possibly raise the cooling capability in limited sections.   One recommendation is to place floor tiles with high percent-open and flow ratings in front of the high-end racks.   Another recommendation is to provide special means for removing hot exhaust air from the backs of the high-end racks immediately, before it has a chance to migrate back to the air intakes on racks in other parts of the room.  This could be accomplished by installing special baffling or direct ducting back to the air returns on the CRAC units.  Careful engineering is required to ensure that any recommendation does not have an adverse effect on the dynamics of the underfloor static pressure and airflow distribution. In centers where floor space is not an issue, it would be most practical to design the entire raised floor to a constant level of cooling and depopulate racks or observe a greater distance between racks in order to meet the per-cabinet capability of the floor.   Floor tile placement and openingsPerforated tiles should be placed exclusively in the cold aisles, aligned with the intakes of the equipment.  No perforated tiles should be placed in the hot aisles, no matter how uncomfortably hot.  Hot aisles are, by design, supposed to be hot.  Placement of open tiles in the hot aisle artificially decreases the return air temperature to the CRAC units, thereby reducing their efficiency and available capacity.  This phenomenon contributes to hot spot problems in the data center.  Perforated tiles should not be placed in too close proximity to the CRAC units.  In areas under the raised floor where air velocities exceed about 530 feet-per-minute, usually within about six tiles of the unit discharges, a Venturi effect may be created where room air will be sucked downward into the raised floor, opposite of the desired result of upward chilled air delivery.   The volumetric flow capabilities of floor tiles with various percent-open ratings are shown in the following figure.  Floor tiles in typical data centers deliver between 100 and 300 cfm.  By optimizing the flow utilizing some of the guidelines set forth in this document, it may be possible to realize flows as high as 500 cfm. Flow rates as high as 700-800 cfm per tile are possible with tiles with the highest percent-open rating. Floor tiles must be aligned in the cold aisles with the intake locations on the equipment. Openings in the raised-floor that are not there for the purpose of delivering chilled air directly to the equipment in the data center space should be completely sealed with brush assemblies or other cable opening material (for example, foam sheeting, fire pillows).  Other openings that must be sealed are holes in data center perimeter walls, underfloor, and ceiling.  Sealing all openings will help maximize under-floor static pressure, ensure optimal airflow to the cold aisles where it is needed, and eliminate short-circuiting of unused air to the CRAC unit returns.

 System air distribution Careful attention should be given to the method of air distribution to eliminate areas of excessive air motion and hot spots. Regardless of the type of system, it should use predominantly recirculated air with a set minimum of fresh air for personnel. This helps eliminate the introduction of dust, reduces the latent load, and allows the system to carry on a sensible cooling operation. The various methods of air distribution and computer room air conditioning (CRAC) are shown in the following figures. In general you should ensure that the design supply and return air temperatures are within the manufacturer's specifications for CRAC units. Underfloor air distributionIn underfloor air distribution, the space between the regular building floor and the raised floor is used as a means to supply air for equipment cooling (see the following figure).  Concrete subfloors might require treatment to prevent the release of dust. Air is discharged into the room through perforated panel floor registers. The air is returned directly to the air conditioning system or by means of a ceiling return system. Remove obsolete cabling (as required in the United States National Electrical Code) and seal all raised-floor openings that are not specifically intended to supply cool air to equipment intakes. A higher return air temperature can be tolerated in underfloor air distribution without affecting the design conditions of the overall room. The underfloor design takes into consideration a heat transfer factor through the raised metal floor and also provides some reheated air to control the relative humidity before it enters the room.    A temperature control system would consist of the same controls as described for the single duct system. In addition, the system must have controls for air temperature in the under floor supply system to prevent under floor temperatures from getting below the room dew point. Air entering the server through the cable holes must be within operating limits. (See Temperature and humidity design criteria).   Combination overhead and under floor systemFor a combination overhead and under floor air circulation design, the primary air conditioning unit is inside the room and the secondary air conditioning unit is outside the room. See following figure. An air handler, with separate controls, supplies conditioned and filtered air to the area under the raised floor. The air is discharged into the room through floor panels or registers. This air absorbs the heat generated by the server and is discharged from the top or rear of the servers into the room. The relative humidity of the air supplied to the information technology equipment should be below 80 percent and the temperature should be controlled to prevent condensation on or within the servers. It might be necessary to provide for a reheating system to operate with the cooling unit to control relative humidity.    The second air handling system supplies air directly to the room through a separate supply system and should be large enough to absorb the remaining heat load in the computer room. It should maintain room temperature and relative humidity as specified and give continuous air conditioning and ventilation. Overhead air circulationIn overhead air circulation, the entire heat load of the room or area, including the heat generated by the information technology equipment, is absorbed by the air supplied to the computer room and the area diffuser system or by a pressurized ceiling supply.  The air returned to the air conditioning system is from either ceiling return registers above the heat-producing servers, or from a fixed pattern of return registers both in the ceiling and on the walls of the room. The following figure shows an overhead air circulation system. To maximize the cooling capability of such an arrangement, it is imperative to align the supply discharges with the cold aisles and the return grilles with the hot aisles. The supply discharges should force air directly down into the cold aisles and not use diffusers that distribute air laterally. Such diffusion can cause cool air to migrate undesirably into the return air path prior to having the opportunity to transfer heat from the equipment. A temperature control system should consist of temperature and humidity controls. These controls should be placed in a representative location within the machine room. The temperature and humidity recorder (described in Temperature and humidity design criteria) should be mounted next to the controls to monitor conditions.   Air filtrationA high efficiency filter should be installed to filter all air supplied to the computer room. Because mechanical and electrostatic air cleaners operate on different principles, a different rating is specified for each type. Ratings are determined by using the test methods outlined in the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard No. 52-76 (or national equivalent). Special air filtration is necessary where installations are exposed to corrosive gases, salt air, or unusual dirt or dust conditions.   Mechanical air filters must be rated at a minimum initial atmospheric dust-spot efficiency of 40 percent.  Electrostatic air filters are designed to operate at 85 to 90 percent efficiency at a given face velocity. The filter must be operated in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation to prevent bypass and ozone buildup, which can be detrimental to certain servers.

 Environmental design criteria Use these environmental design criteria to ensure that your data center environment provides optimal conditions for your server operation. The following environmental specifications are based on an altitude 1800 m (5906 ft above sea level).  Some systems have more restrictive requirements on temperature, moisture, and altitude.  For more information, see the individual system specifications. Airborne particulates (including metal flakes or particles) and reactive gases acting alone or in combination with other environmental factors such as humidity or temperature might pose a risk to the server. Risks that are posed by the presence of excessive particulate levels or concentrations of harmful gases include damage that might cause the server to malfunction or cease functioning altogether. The environmental specifications set forth limits for particulates and gases that are intended to avoid such damage. The limits must not be viewed or used as definitive limits because numerous other factors, such as temperature or moisture content of the air, can influence the impact of particulates or environmental corrosives and gaseous contaminant transfer. In the absence of specific limits that are set forth in the environmental specifications, you must implement practices that maintain particulate or gas levels that are consistent with the protection of human health and safety.  Temperature 18Â°C (64.4Â°F) â 27Â°C (80.6Â°F)4 Low-end moisture 5.5Â°C (41.9Â°F) dew point High-end moisture 60% relative humidity or 15Â°C (59Â°F) dew point Gaseous contamination Severity level G1 as per ANSI/ISA 71.04-19852, which states that the reactivity rate of copper coupons shall be less than 300 Angstroms per month (Ã/month, â 0.0039 Î¼g/cm2-hour weight gain).6 In addition, the reactivity rate of silver coupons shall be less than 300Ã/month (â 0.0035 Î¼g/cm2-hour weight gain).7 The reactive monitoring of gaseous corrosivity should be conducted approximately 5 cm (2 in.) in front of the rack on the air inlet side at one-quarter and three-quarter frame height off the floor or where the air velocity is much higher.   Particulate contamination Data centers must meet the cleanliness level of ISO 14644-1 class 8. For data centers without airside economizer, the ISO 14644-1 class 8 cleanliness might be met simply by the choice of the following filtration:The room air might be continuously filtered with MERV 8 filters. Air entering a data center might be filtered with MERV 11 or preferably MERV 13 filters. For data centers with airside economizers, the choice of filters to achieve ISO class 8 cleanliness depends on the specific conditions present at that data center.  The deliquescent relative humidity of the particulate contamination should be more than 60% RH.3  Data centers must be free of zinc whiskers.8  The class 1 and class 2 temperature and moisture limits, measured at the IT equipment air inlet, are from ASHRAE Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments, second edition (2009).  Maximum recommended ambient temperature reduces 1Â°C (1.8Â°F) for every 300 m (984 ft) over 1800 m (5906 ft). The ASHRAE class 1 allowable ranges are 15Â°C â 32Â°C, 20% â 80% relative humidity, and the class 2 allowable ranges are 10Â°C â 35Â°C, 20% â 80% relative humidity.  For extended periods of time, IT manufacturers recommend that data center operators maintain the recommended environment for maximum reliability. The allowable environment is where IT manufacturers test their equipment operation in order to verify that the equipment operates. This is not a statement of reliability, but one of functional IT equipment. ANSI/ISA-S71.04. 1985. Environmental conditions for process measurement and control systems: Airborne contaminants, Instrument Society of America, Research Triangle Park, NC, 1985. The deliquescent relative humidity of particulate contamination is the relative humidity at which the dust absorbs enough water to become wet and promote ionic conduction. For ambient temperatures exceeding 25Â°C (77Â°F), the acoustical noise levels of the system might increase as the speed of the air moving devices increases.  For acclimation considerations of IT equipment, see .  The derivation of the equivalence between the rate of copper corrosion product thickness growth in Ã/month and the rate of weight gain assumes that Cu2S and Cu2O grow in equal proportions. The derivation of the equivalence between the rate of silver corrosion product thickness growth in Ã/month and the rate of weight gain assumes that Ag2S is the only corrosion product. Surface debris is randomly collected from 10 areas of the data center on a 1.5 cm diameter disk of sticky electrically conductive tape on a metal stub. If examination of the sticky tape in a scanning electron microscope reveals no zinc whiskers, the data center is considered free of zinc whiskers. Temperature 5Â°C (41Â°F) â 45Â°C (113Â°F) Relative humidity 8% â 80% Dew point Less than 27Â°C (81Â°F) Gaseous contamination Severity level G1 as per ANSI/ISA 71.04-19851, which states that the reactivity rate of copper coupons shall be less than 300 Angstroms per month (Ã/month, â 0.0039 Î¼g/cm2-hour weight gain).3 In addition, the reactivity rate of silver coupons shall be less than 300Ã/month (â 0.0035 Î¼g/cm2-hour weight gain).4 The reactive monitoring of gaseous corrosivity should be conducted approximately 2 in. (5 cm) in front of the rack on the air inlet side at one-quarter and three-quarter frame height off the floor or where the air velocity is much higher.  ANSI/ISA-S71.04. 1985.

Ensure that you backup your data first, if applicable, before shipping. Air qualityMany systems are installed in environments other than the typical data center, business office, or clean industrial location. These environments might exhibit various temperatures, relative humidity, and levels of airborne particles or corrosive gases.  systems are designed to work within the environmental specifications shown in the previous tables unless otherwise noted on an individual system specification. An environment is considered unacceptable when the temperature, relative humidity, corrosive gases, or solid particles in the air exceed specific limits set by IBM.  Equipment that operates in environments classified as unacceptable might be subject to degraded performance and permanent damage if the equipment is not designed for such environments. ContaminantsSystems are being installed in increasingly diversified industries.  Some of these industries, as a by-product of their processes, cause the atmosphere to contain measurable quantities of gases and solid particles that are potentially harmful to electronic equipment. Urban areas that are highly industrialized might have levels of gases and solid particles that cause an unacceptable environment exposure to exist throughout an entire area. IBM is concerned with two classes of atmospheric contaminants; solid particles and gases.  Solid particles in the air are referred to as particulates. Water vapor can combine with these tiny, solid particles and form compounds.  Such matter is said to be hygroscopic.  It can be harmful, depending on the particulate composition.  Gases can form harmful acids or bases when combined with water.   Because of the ability to absorb moisture, the relative humidity and temperature are significant factors in an unacceptable environment. High concentrations of gases, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and acidic gaseous chlorine, which are associated with industrial processes, are known to cause corrosion and failure of electronic components.  In addition to gases, some industrial processes produce particulate contamination. These particles can settle (in the form of dust) in surrounding areas even though the process producing the particles might be some distance away. Industries engaged in processing petroleum, chemicals, primary metals, food, mining, and paper have a higher probability of encountering an unacceptable environment.  However, contamination can be a result of construction, cleaning, or other activities that can occur anywhere. A visual inspection is the first step in determining the likelihood of contamination.  Some indicators of an unacceptable environment might include corrosion of metal such as door handles and hinges.  Often, the presence of contaminants can be determined by odor as in the case of chlorine or sulfur, which have a distinctive smell.  Observe whether a heavy layer of dust settles on surfaces, especially in the primary metals industry.  This dust is often conductive and can create electrical arcing or short circuits if drawn into electronic equipment. To determine adherence to IBM requirements for gases and particulates, laboratory techniques are necessary.  Testing for gases and particulates involves special equipment and procedures.  Contact your IBM installation planning representative for guidance. Recommended solutions might include, but are not limited to, room pressurization, tighter relative humidity control, filtration, maintenance, and monitoring.

 Acclimation Server and storage equipment must be acclimated to the surrounding environment to prevent condensation. When server and storage equipment is shipped in a climate where the outside temperature is below the dew point of an indoor location, there is a possibility that water condensation will form on the cooler surfaces inside the equipment when brought into a warmer indoor environment. If condensation occurs, sufficient time must be allowed for the equipment to reach equilibrium with the warmer indoor temperature before removing the shipping bag, if used. Leave the system in the shipping bag, if used, for up to 48 hours, or until there is no visible signs of condensation, to let it acclimate to the indoor environment. Parent topic:          
 Space requirements The floor area required for the equipment is determined by the specific servers to be installed, the location of columns, floor loading capacity, and provisions for future expansion.  See Floor construction and floor loading to review floor loading and weight distribution for your system. When the amount of space is determined, allow for the addition of furniture, carts, and storage cabinets. Additional space, not necessarily in the computer area, is required for air conditioning, electrical, security systems, and fire protection equipment as well as for the storage of tapes, forms, and other supplies. Additional space might be needed to access the server (for example, rack-door-opening clearance). Plan to store all combustible materials in properly designed and protected storage areas.  A computer room or area should be separated from adjacent areas to allow for air conditioning, fire protection, and security. The floor-to-ceiling height must be sufficient to allow server top covers to open for service and should be adequate to allow air circulation from the data processing machine. Recommended heights are 2.6 m to 2.9 m (8 ft 6 in. to 9 ft 6 in.) from the building floor or (if used) from the raised floor to ceiling, but higher ceilings are acceptable. In new construction or remodeling, the computer room area should have a minimum door width of 914 mm (36 in.). Because many machine frames are close to 914 mm (36 in.) in width, the use of a 1067 mm (42 in.) door width would be preferable. The door height should be a minimum of 2032 mm (80 in.) of unobstructed height (no threshold plate). Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Floor construction and floor loading Calculate the floor loads for your server with these formulas. A floor loading assessment is the evaluation of the concrete subfloor, not the raised floor. The weight of the raised floor is considered in the floor loading formula. The building floor must support the weight of the equipment to be installed. Although older devices might impose 345 kg/m2 (75 lb/ft2) on the building floor, a typical server design imposes a load of no more than 340 kg/m2 (70 lb/ft2). The following pounds-per-square-foot (lb/ft2) formula is used to calculate floor loading. For assistance with floor load evaluation, contact a structural engineer. Floor Loading is equal to: (machine weight + (15 lb/ft2 x 0.5 svc clear) + (10 lb/ft2 x total area))/ total area The floor loading should not exceed 240 kg/m2 (50 lb/ft2) with a partition allowance of 100 kg/m2 (20 lb/ft2) for a total floor load rating of 340 kg/m2 (70 lb/ft2). The raised-floor weight plus the cable weight adds 50 kg/m2 (10 lb/ft2) uniformly across the total area used in calculations and is included in the 340 kg/m2 (70 lb/ft2) floor loading. (The total area is defined as: machine area + 0.5 service clearance.)  When the service clearance area is also used to distribute machine weight (weight distribution/service clearance), 75 kg/m2 (15 lb/ft2) is considered for personnel and equipment traffic. The distribution weight is applied over 0.5 of the clearance up to a maximum of 760 mm (30 in.) as measured from the machine frame. The raised floor on which the system is to be installed must be capable of supporting the system's weight. Contact the raised floor tile manufacturer, a structural engineer, or both to verify that the raised floor is safe to support a concentrated load equal to one third of the total weight of one rack on a single raised floor tile. Under certain circumstances, such as relocation, it is possible that the concentrated load on a single raised floor tile can be as high as one half of the total weight of one rack per caster. When you are installing two adjacent racks, it is possible that one caster from each rack can be on the same raised floor tile. The load on the raised floor tile can be as high as one third of the total weight of both racks.  Depending on the type of raised floor tile, additional supports, such as pedestals, might be necessary to maintain the structural integrity of an uncut tile or to restore the integrity of a tile that is cut for cable entry or air supply. Contact the raised floor tile manufacturer, a structural engineer, or both to ensure that the raised floor tiles and pedestals can support the concentrated loads. Parent topic:          
 Raised floors Learn how a raised floor environment improves data center operational efficiency. A raised floor accomplishes the following major objectives:       Improves operational efficiency and allows greater flexibility in the arrangement of equipment  Permits the space between the two floors to be used to supply cooling air to the equipment or area  Allows for future layout change with minimum reconstruction cost Protects the interconnecting cables and power receptacles Prevents tripping hazards A raised floor should be constructed of fire-resistant or noncombustible material. The two general floor types are shown in the following figure. The first figure is of a stringerless floor, and the second figure is a floor with stringers. Raised floor factors:    No metal or highly-conductive material that might be at ground potential should be exposed to the walking surface when a metallic raised-floor structure is used. Such exposure is considered an electrical safety hazard. The raised-floor height should be between 155 mm (6 in.) and 750 mm (30 in.). For processors with multiple channels, a minimum raised-floor height of 305 mm (12 in.) is recommended. Clearance must be adequate to accommodate interconnecting cables, fiber cable raceways, power distribution, and any piping that is present under the floor. Experience has shown that higher raised-floor heights allow better air-conditioning balance in the room. Caster point loads on some servers can be as high as 455 kg (1,000 lb) concentrated load anywhere on the panel with a 2 mm (0.080 in.) maximum deflection .  When a raised-floor panel is cut for cable entry or air supply, an additional panel support (pedestal) might be required to restore the structural integrity of the panel to the above requirement. Use protective covering (such as plywood, tempered masonite, or plyron panels) to prevent damage to floor tiles, carpeting, and panels while equipment is being moved into or is relocated within the installation. When the equipment is moved, the dynamic load on the casters is significantly greater than when the equipment is stationary.   Concrete subfloors require treatment to prevent the release of dust.   Use noncombustible protective molding to eliminate sharp edges on all floor cutouts to prevent damage to cables and hoses and to prevent casters from rolling into the floor cutout. Pedestals must be firmly attached to the structural (concrete) floor using an adhesive. Cable cutout size information is determined by the volume of cables passing through the cutout. See the server's documentation for recommendations on the cable cutout size. Signal reference groundTo minimize the effects of high-frequency (HF) interference and other undesired electrical signals (commonly referred to as electrical noise), a Signal Reference System (SRS) may be recommended. An SRS may be made up of a Signal Reference Ground or Grid (SRG), or a Signal Reference Plane (SRP). A Signal Reference Ground or Grid may also be known as a Zero Signal Reference Ground (ZSRG). Regardless of the name used, the intent is to provide an equal potential point of reference for equipment installed in a contiguous area for a wide range of frequencies. This is accomplished by installing a network of low impedance conductors throughout the information technology room. Access (raised) flooring systems that utilize bolted stringer construction can be used to provide a simple SRG. Floor systems that have either no stringer or snap-in stringers do not provide for an effective SRG, and other methods for installing a SRG should be used.  For safety requirements, the SRG must be connected to earth ground. SRG practices recommend that all metallic objects that cross the SRG area are to be bonded (mechanically connected) to the SRG. For more information on Signal Reference Grounds, contact your  installation planning representative. Contaminants that conduct electricity need to be reduced in data center environments. Parent topic:          
 Conductive contamination Contaminants that conduct electricity need to be reduced in data center environments. Semiconductors and sensitive electronics used in current information technology equipment have allowed for the manufacture of very high density electronic circuitry. Although new technology allows for significant increases or capacity in a smaller physical space, it is susceptible to contamination, especially contamination particles that will conduct electricity. Since the early 1990s, it has been determined that data center environments may contain sources of conductive contamination. Contaminants include: carbon fibers, metallic debris such as aluminum, copper and steel filings from construction, and zinc whiskers from zinc-electroplated materials used in raised floor structures.    Although very small, and at times not easily seen without the visual aid of magnifying lenses, this type of contamination can have disastrous impact on equipment availability and reliability. Errors, component damage and equipment outages caused by conductive contamination can be difficult to diagnose. Failures may be at first attributed to other more common factors such as lightning events or electrical power quality or even just presumed to be defective parts. Zinc whiskersThe most common conductive contamination in raised-floor data centers is what is known as zinc whiskers. It is the most common because it is frequently found on the underside of certain types of access floor tiles. Typically, the wood core style floor tile has a flat steel bottom. The steel may be coated with zinc either by a hot-dip-galvanize process or by zinc electroplate. The zinc electroplate steel exhibits a phenomena that appears as whisker-like growths on the surface. These small particles of approximately 1-2 mm (.04-.08 in.) in length can break away from the surface and get pulled into the cooling air stream. Eventually they might be ingested by the equipment air, settle on a circuit board and create a problem. If you suspect that you may have this type of problem, contact your . The following figure shows light reflection from zinc whiskers. Parent topic:          
 Overhead cabling Historically, cabling (power or signal) for computer systems has been done within a rack or under a raised floor. There has been growing customer interest in using nonraised floors, requiring some or all of the cabling to be overhead.  This information describes the considerations associated with overhead cabling of  19-inch racks and 24-inch racks ordered with  servers.  As with all electronic devices, cables and power cords can act as antennas, emitting electromagnetic energy. The levels released are small (less than a mobile phone) and are not dangerous to people, but can interfere with other electronic devices. For example, a mobile phone's emission is measured in volts per meter while a  cable emission is measured in microvolts per meter. However, small amounts of electromagnetic emissions can add up as several cables emit more electromagnetic energy than a single cable. Laying cables on a concrete floor helps to reduce emissions as the floor absorbs some of the energy. Placing cables under a raised floor also helps to reduce emissions. However, when suspending cables in the air, this type of cable layout eliminates the emission reductions provided by a concrete subfloor, a raised floor, or both. IBM supported configurations for servers and I/O units in racks have passed both industry and IBM tests requirements for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). These tests are completed by laying cables on the floor. To support overhead cabling, additional testing is required by placing the cables overhead and retesting selected configurations. Many overhead cabling configurations have not been tested and are not supported by IBM.  Therefore, overhead cabling with a Power Systems server in IBM 19-inch and 24-inch racks is generally an unsupported configuration. Generally, using overhead cabling is not a problem. The potential for causing interference with any device outside the data center is quite small.  However, the only way to know if a configuration would be problematic is to test it and see if there are interference problems in the data center. If the overhead cabling is causing a problem, it could affect a wireless device in the data center (for example, a wireless temperature or humidity probe trying to report data at a constant rate, but which is sending wrong or intermittent data instead). The interference could be on a two-way radio that has more background noise than expected. Or, the interference could be poor reception in a radio or television. It is possible that the emissions from overhead cabling could cause problems with another computer or storage equipment in the data center, but it is unlikely. There are different actions that you can take to mitigate emissions when using overhead cabling. Note that, while helpful, using these mitigation techniques does not mean you have   supported configuration because   has not conducted extensive testing for your specific configuration. The mitigations might address all the problems, but until tested and certified, the system is not officially supported by . Example mitigations are as follows:Use shielded (Ethernet) cables in place of unshielded (Ethernet) cables.    Add shielding to the cable paths, and ground the shielding on both ends of the cable.  Add shielding to the cables themselves.  Add filters (chokes, pigtails, ferrite cores, and other such filters) to the cables. Filters reduce emissions over a specific frequency range. Different types of cables emit differently based on their composition, length, signals carried, and where they are attached. A fiber optic cable does not emit radio frequency (RF) like a metallic cable unless the fiber optic cable has a metallic shield. Power cords, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), serial-attached SCSI (SAS), copper Fibre Channel, and system power control network (SPCN) cables typically have modest emissions. InfiniBand cables are significant emitters when compared to power cords. Unshielded Ethernet cables are probably the most significant emitters. Longer metallic cables can be thought of as bigger antennas and emit more. Shorter cables emit less. If you have multiple 19-inch or 24-inch racks and need to run cables from one rack to the other, you can reduce emissions by keeping the cables in the rack instead of going over the top and into the other rack.  Using overhead cables with your Power Systems servers does not void your IBM warranty or maintenance agreement.1 However, if IBM service and support believes that a problem might be related to the use of overhead cabling, then IBM service and support has the right to suspend the warranty or maintenance agreement until the system is put back into compliance. Therefore, overhead cabling options should be discussed with your local IBM service and support organization before you implement a new cabling scheme. Cables can always be routed out the bottom of the product in accordance with the product installation instructions. After the cables are routed to exit the bottom of the product, they can be externally routed upward to the overhead cabling trays using appropriate cable management techniques. 1The customer must not cut or drill any additional holes or openings into the product enclosure under any circumstances.  Any alteration of the physical structure of an enclosure voids the product safety certifications received for the product. Parent topic:          
 Computer room layout Effective computer room layout is dependent on several important factors. The factors for effective computer room layout are as follows. Service clearance and floor loadingEach piece of equipment that you plan to install has some minimum amount of space around it that is required to be kept clear so that service might be performed on that equipment, if it become necessary. Beyond keeping a clear area around the equipment, it is advisable that traffic patterns for work flow do not fall in service clearance boundaries. Do not allow the service clearance areas to be used for temporary or permanent storage. Exact clearance dimensions are supplied with the individual product specifications.   Generally, floor loading areas fall inside the service clearance boundaries. Consult individual product planning documentation and your seller for specific information about the equipment that you are planning to install. If you have not yet done so, review floor loading, weight distribution, service clearance, and machine area.  Physical and logical prioritySome types of peripheral equipment might require physical or logical positioning in relation to the processor or other equipment that might dictate where that equipment must be placed on your floor. Consult individual product planning documentation and your seller to determine if equipment that you are planning to install must be specifically placed. Such equipment should be situated in your floor layout diagrams first, before other equipment that does not require precise positioning.    Restrictive cable lengthsAs computing power increases, cable lengths might decrease to support improvements in processing speed. Consult product-specific planning documentation and your seller to determine where cable lengths will allow you to place each piece of equipment on your floor. Review cabling and connectivity, especially if you are using Integrated Cluster Bus (ICB) cables.   Practical work space and safetyAllow enough room around equipment for normal movement of work flow. Consider the placement of equipment in relation to entrances and exits, windows, columns, wall-mounted equipment, such as circuit breaker boxes and electrical outlets, safety equipment, fire extinguishers, storage areas, and furniture. Be especially careful to allow easy access to things like the emergency power-off controls, smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, and under-floor or in-ceiling fire extinguishing systems.    If possible, make plans now to allow for future additional equipment. Plan cable routing and server locations to make it easy for additional units to be added.   Other equipmentIn addition to the information technology equipment that you will be installing, allow room for office furniture and equipment, power and air conditioning, storage for operating supplies, and miscellaneous considerations, such as a meeting area, vending machine location, or water fountains.   It is highly recommended that scale drawings of your proposed layout be prepared and reviewed by both your seller and all service providers to ensure that your floor layout is physically capable and practically useful. Following is a chart of standard symbols used to create floor layouts. Parent topic:          
 Vibration and shock Use this information to plan for possible vibration and shock in your data center. It might be necessary to install the information technology equipment in an area subject to minor vibrations. The following information supplies vibration and shock limits for your equipment and some basic definitions concerning vibration. The vibration levels normally present in computer-room and industrial installations are well within the indicated levels. However, mounting the equipment in racks, stackers, or similar equipment might increase the risks of vibration-related problems. It is important to consult the manufacturer of such equipment to ensure that vibration factors will not exceed the specifications provided in the following tables. Some useful definitions of vibration include:    Acceleration: Normally measured in g multiples of the acceleration because of the force of gravity. If the frequency is also known for a sine wave, acceleration can be calculated from displacement.  is the unit of acceleration caused by the force of gravity. Continuous: Vibrations present over an extended period and cause a sustained resonant response in the equipment.  Displacement: Magnitude of the wave shape; normally given in peak-to-peak displacement in English or metric units:Normally used to measure floor vibrations at low frequencies If the frequency is also known, it can be converted to displacement g for a sine wave.  Many measuring instruments can convert displacement to g for either sinusoidal or complex wave shapes. Peak: The maximum value of a sinusoidal or random vibration. This can be expressed as peak-to-peak in cases of sinusoidal vibration displacement. Random: A complex vibration wave form varying in amplitude and frequency content.    rms (root mean square):  The long-term average of the acceleration or amplitude values. Normally used as a measure of overall vibration for random vibration. Shock: Intermittent inputs that occur and then decay to zero prior to a recurrence of the event. Typical examples are foot traffic, fork lifts in aisles, and external events such as railroad, highway traffic, or construction activities (including blasting). Sinusoidal: Vibrations with the characteristic shape of the classical sine wave (for example, 60-Hz ac power). Transient: Vibrations that are intermittent and do not cause a sustained resonant response in the equipment.    If you need to make any calculations or require information regarding the above definitions, consult a mechanical engineer, a vibration consulting engineer, or your seller.    The three classes of a vibration environment are shown in the following table. Class Vibration environment V1 Floor-mounted machines in an office environment V2 Table-top and wall-mounted machines V3 Heavy industrial and mobile equipment A summary of the vibration limits for each of the three classes is shown in the following table. A legend follows the table.   Vibration levels at any discrete frequency should not exceed a level of 1/2 the g rms values for the class listed in the Operational vibration and shock limits table. Class g rms g peak Mils Shock V1 L 0.10 0.30 3.4 3 g at 3 ms V1 H 0.05 0.15 1.7 3 g at 3 ms V2 0.10 0.30 3.4 3 g at 3 ms V3 0.27 0.80 9.4 application dependent L: Light, weight less than 600 kg (1322.8 lb). H: Heavy, weight equal to or greater than 600 kg (1322.8 lb). g rms: Overall average g level over the 5 to 500 Hz frequency range. g peak:  Maximum real-time instantaneous peak value of the vibration time history wave form (excluding events defined as shocks).  Mils: Peak-to-peak displacement of a discrete frequency in the 5 to 17 Hz range. One mil equal .001 inch. Shock: Amplitude and pulse width of a classical 1/2 sine shock pulse. The values given in the Operational vibration and shock limits table are based on worst-case field data measured at customer installations for current and previously released products. The vibration and shock environment will not exceed these values except for abnormal cases involving earthquakes or direct impacts.     Earthquakes Special frame-strengthening features or RPQs might be required in earthquake prone areas. Local codes might require the information technology equipment to be tied down to the concrete floor. If sufficient information on equipment tie down is not provided in the product's physical planning documentation, consult with your seller. Parent topic:          
 Lighting Proper lighting is required to normally operate the server and when service is required. Light sources in the equipment room and work station areas should have a general lighting level of 300 - 500 lumens/m2 (lux) or 30 - 50 foot-candles. When preparing the equipment room and work areas, consider painting the room a light color with a white ceiling to reflect (rather than absorb) light. To lessen any glare, windows should not be in an operator's field of vision or directly facing the display screen. Direct sunlight can cause light-sensing devices to malfunction and make observations of various signal lamps difficult.   To avoid eye fatigue, light sources should be compatible. Universal white fluorescent lamps are compatible with both incandescent lamps and daylight.  The following figure shows a suggested lighting layout for a workstation. Provide and maintain emergency lighting, of sufficient intensity, to ensure a safe exit. Parent topic:          
 Electromagnetic compatibility Use this information to plan for server installation in an environment that has a high electomagnetic-radiated field. Information technology equipment installation might occasionally be planned in an area that has a high electromagnetic-radiated field environment. This condition results when the information technology equipment is near a radio frequency source such as a radio-transmitting antenna (AM, FM, TV, or two-core radio), civilian and military radar, and certain industrial machines (rf induction heaters, rf arc welders, and insulation testers). If any of these sources are near the proposed site, a planning review might be appropriate to assess the environment and determine whether any special installation or product considerations are advisable to reduce interference. Consult your seller. Workstations located near devices like transformers or buried electrical conduits can experience jitter on the workstation display in the presence of strong magnetic fields. Most products can tolerate low-frequency to very-high-frequency rf levels of 3 volts per meter. Field strengths greater than 3 volts per meter might cause operational or serviceability problems. Products have different tolerance levels to electromagnetic-radiated fields in different frequency ranges. Radar (frequency of 1300 MHz, and 2800 MHz) signals with field strengths of a maximum of 5 volts per meter are acceptable. If problems occur, reorientation of the server or selective shielding might be required.    Two-core radio or cellular telephone usage should be properly controlled in the computer room. To reduce the likelihood of a problem, the following recommendations should be considered when operating such equipment:    Keep hand-held transmitters (for example, walkie-talkies, radio paging, and cellular telephones) a minimum of 1.5 m (5 ft) from information technology equipment. Use only an operator-controlled transmitting device (no automatic transmissions). Develop specific rules, such as - Do not transmit within 1.5 m (5 ft) of a fully covered operating server. If covers are open, do not transmit. Choose the minimum output power that will accomplish your communication needs. Extremely low frequency (ELF) fieldsWith the exception of some video display cathode ray tubes (CRT), most information technology equipment is tolerant of extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields. The video displays that use cathode ray tubes are more sensitive because they use electromagnetic fields to position the electron beam in normal operation. The extremely low frequency range covers frequencies between 0 and 300 Hz. It is also referred to as electrical power frequency because most world electrical power is generated at either 50 or 60 Hz.  products tolerate ELF electromagnetic fields in the following ranges: Cathode ray tube video display: 15-20 milligauss Liquid crystal display (LCD) : 10 Gauss  Magnetic tape equipment: 20 Gauss Disk drive equipment : 20 Gauss Processors or servers : 20 Gauss Typical information technology centers exhibit an ambient electromagnetic field between 3-8 milligauss. Some equipment within a center may, under normal operation,  produce fields in excess of 100 milligauss. Examples of equipment that produces large magnetic fields include: power distribution units, electric motors, electrical transformers, laser printers and uninterruptible power systems. However, magnetic field density decreases rapidly with distance. If a CRT display is located near equipment that produces large electromagnetic fields, the display may exhibit distortion such as poor focus, change in image shape or slight motion in static display images. Moving the CRT away from the equipment may remedy the problem. Parent topic:          
 Computer room location Computer room location is affected by several factors. Before selecting a location for the computer, give attention to these guidelines:    The computer room should be in a noncombustible or fire-resistant building or room.  The computer room should not be above, below, or adjacent to areas where hazardous materials or gases are stored, manufactured, or processed. If the computer must be located near such an area, take extra precautions to safeguard the area. If the computer room is below ground level, provide adequate drainage. Safety consideration and fire preventionSafety is a vital factor when planning computer installation. This consideration is reflected in the choice of the computer location, building materials used, fire prevention equipment, air conditioning and electrical systems, and personnel training.    If an inconsistency occurs between your server's recommendations and any local or national regulation, the more stringent of the recommendations or regulations should take precedence. The National Fire Protection Association standard, NFPA 75, provides guidelines for protection of information technology equipment. The customer is responsible for adherence to governmental regulations.    Computer room walls should have a minimum of a 1-hour-fire-resistance rating and extend from the structural floor to the structural ceiling (slab-to-slab). In rooms used for critical operations, it is preferable to install processors in 1-hour-fire-rated rooms separate from the main computer room. If the computer room has one or more outside walls adjacent to a building that is susceptible to fire, consider taking the following precautionary actions:   Installing shatterproof windows in the computer room to improve the safety of personnel and equipment from flying debris and water damage. Usually, windows in the computer room are undesirable because of security concerns, and the negative effect they have on temperature control. They can cause excessive heating in the summer, and excessive cooling in the winter. Installing sprinklers outside the windows to protect them with a blanket of water if a fire occurs in the adjacent area. Sealing the windows with masonry.  Where a false (or hung) ceiling or insulating material is to be added, ensure that it is noncombustible or fire-resistant material. All duct work should be noncombustible. If combustible material is used in the space between the structural ceiling and the false ceiling, appropriate protection should be provided.   A raised floor that is installed over the structural floor should be constructed of noncombustible or fire-retardant materials. If the structural floor is of combustible material, it should be protected by water sprinklers on the ceiling of the room below.   Before the information technology equipment is installed, the space between the raised and the structural floors should be cleared of debris. This space should also be checked periodically after installation to keep it free of accumulated dust, possible debris, and unused cables.  The roof, ceiling, and floor above the computer room and the storage area for recorded media should be watertight. Liquid piping, roof drains, and other potential sources of liquid damage should be rerouted around the area. The space under the raised floor in the computer room should be provided with drainage to protect against flooding or trapped water. Waste material containers should be constructed of metal with a frame-suppressant lid. Fire prevention equipment in a computer roomFire prevention equipment in the computer room should be installed as an added safety measure. A fire suppression system is the responsibility of the customer. Your insurance underwriter, local fire marshall, and local building inspector are all parties that should be consulted in selecting a fire suppression system that provides the correct level of coverage and protection.   designs and manufactures equipment to internal and external standards that require certain environments for reliable operation. Because   does not test any equipment for compatibility with fire suppression systems,   does not make compatibility claims of any kind nor does   provide recommendations on fire suppression systems.    An early-warning fire detection system should be installed to protect the computer room and storage areas for recorded media. This system should activate both an audible and a visual alarm in the rooms and at a monitored central station.  Portable carbon dioxide fire extinguishers, of suitable size and number, should be provided in the computer room for use on electrical equipment.   Portable, pressurized-water extinguishers should be provided for combustible material such as paper. Extinguishers should be readily accessible to individuals in the area, and extinguisher locations should be marked so they are visible. Automatic sprinkler systems and gaseous total flooding systems are acceptable forms of fixed protection. For information on environmentally friendly gases for total flooding systems, consult NFPA 2001 titled Standard on Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems. Special consideration should be used if you prefer a gaseous total flooding system. If a gaseous total flooding system is installed, include a time delay feature that allows investigation and evacuation from the covered area of the gaseous total flooding system. A cross-zoned detection system is suggested. The protected area must be evacuated whenever the gaseous total flooding system or its controls are being serviced. Additionally, a master Disarm switch, available for use by the system service personnel, is required. With the switch set in the off position, the detonators used to release the gaseous total flooding system must be made inoperative, even if the circuit fails elsewhere in the system. This switch must be placed in the off (manual) position before servicing begins to prevent possible accidental discharge of the gaseous total flooding system. Alternatives to ordinary wet pipe sprinkler systems might include dry pipe systems or preaction systems. Water flows into preaction systems only if triggered by smoke or heat detectors. The detection systems should be independent of gaseous total flooding system detection systems. The On-Off type of sprinkler head is not recommended because it is more prone to leakage.  To determine the proper fire protection required for the computer room, consult with your insurance underwriter and your local code authority. Parent topic:          
 Material and data storage protection Special safety considerations are required when storing data or other material.  Consider the following factors:    Any data or material stored in the computer room, whether in the form of magnetic tapes, paper tapes, cards, or paper forms, should be limited to the minimum needed for safe, efficient operation and should be enclosed in metal cabinets or fire-resistant containers when not in use.   For security purposes, and protection against fire, a separate room for material storage is strongly recommended. This room should be constructed of fire-resistant material (minimum 2-hour-fire-resistance rating). An approved fixed extinguishing system is recommended. Fixed extinguishing systems include automatic sprinklers and approved total flooding gaseous systems. If continuity of operation is critical, plan a remote storage location for vital records if a disaster occurs. Key considerations in the choice of an off-site location for data storage are that the area is:    Not subject to the same risk that might occur in the computer room. Suitable for long-term storage of hardcopy records and magnetic media files. Air conditioning systemsIn most installations, the computer area is controlled by a separate air conditioning system. Therefore, emergency power-off switches for the equipment and air conditioning should be placed in convenient locations, preferably near the console operator and next to the main exit doors. See National Fire Protection Association standard, NFPA 70 article 645, for information.  When the regular building air conditioning system is used, with supplemental units in the computer area, the supplemental units would then be handled as stated above. The regular building air conditioning system should have an audible alarm to alert maintenance personnel of an emergency.  Fire dampers should be located in all air ducts at fire walls. The air filters in the air conditioning system should contain noncombustible or self-extinguishing material.  Electrical systemsProvide a mainline disconnect control for the computer equipment at a remote location. The remote controls should be in a convenient location, preferably near the console operator and next to the main exit doors. They should be next to the power-off switch for the air conditioning system and should be properly marked. A light should be installed to indicate when power is on. The National Electric Code (NFPA 70) article 645 states that a single disconnecting means to control both the electronic equipment  and the HVAC system is permitted.  If continuity of operation is essential, a standby power source should be installed. It is advisable to install an automatic battery-operated lighting unit to illuminate an area if a power or lighting circuit failure occurs. This unit is wired to and controlled by the lighting circuit. Watertight connectors are recommended under raised floors because of the moisture exposures (water pipe leaks, high humidity levels) under raised floors. Parent topic:          
 Emergency planning for continuous operations Planning for emergencies ensures that your data center continues to operate in the event of a power outage. If a power outage occurs, continued operation depends on information stored on cards, tapes, or disks, and the equipment used to process the information being available immediately. Arrangements should be made for emergency use of other equipment and transportation of personnel, data, and supplies to a temporary location. Arrangements should also be made to ensure the continuous operation of environment equipment, such as air conditioning. Duplicate or master records and programming data should be maintained in a remote area, from which the necessary information can be taken to resume operation.  Precautions and personnel trainingFurther plans should include training of personnel to act in an emergency situation.      Sound alarm signals for fire detection and for other abnormal conditions to familiarize personnel with the alarm. Monitor the computer room, air conditioning equipment room, and electrical and data storage room at all times. Inspect steam pipes and water pipes above the false ceiling to guard against possible damage due to accidental breakage, leakage, or condensation. Locate emergency exit doors in the computer area. The number of doors depends on the size and location of the area.  Train personnel in emergency measures such as:  Shutting off all electrical power Shutting off the air conditioning system Shutting off the chilled water to the information technology equipment Calling the fire company Handling fire extinguishers in the approved manner  Operating a small-diameter fire hose Evacuating records Evacuating personnel  Administering first aid Lightning protection for communication wiringBe sure to install lightning protection devices to protect communication wiring and equipment from surges and transients induced into the communication wiring. In any area subject to lightning, surge suppressors should be installed at each end of every outdoor cable installation, whether installed above the ground (aerial) or buried below the ground. Information about lightning surge suppressors for communication wiring and recommended methods for outdoor communication cables can be found in the information technology product's physical planning documentation.

 General power information Reliable electrical power is required for the proper functioning of your data processing equipment.  information technology equipment requires a reliable electrical power source that is free from interference or disturbance. Electrical power companies generally supply power of sufficient quality. The Power quality, Voltage and frequency limits, Power load, and Power source topics provide the guidance and specifications needed to meet the requirements of the equipment. Qualified personnel must ensure that electrical power distribution system is safe and meets local and national codes. They must also ensure that the voltage measured at the power receptacle is within the specified tolerance for the equipment. In addition, a separate power feeder is required for items such as lighting and air conditioning. A properly installed electrical power system will help to provide for reliable operation of your  equipment.  Other factors to consider when planning and installing the electrical system include a means of providing a low impedance conducting path to ground (path to earth) and lightning protection. Depending on the geographical location, special considerations may be required for lightning protection. Your electrical contractor should meet all local and national electrical code requirements. Building electrical power is normally derived from a three-phase power distribution system. General office areas are normally provided with single-phase power outlets, and data processing rooms are provided with three-phase power.  Some IT equipment and devices may require standard three-phase power; others may require single-phase power. The power requirements for each device are specified in the individual server specifications for that server. Nominal voltage, plugs, receptacles, and in some cases, conduit and back boxes are listed in the specific server specifications. Refer to the respective server specifications to determine the power requirements. Ensure that existing branch circuit outlets are the correct type and are properly grounded. The quality of electrical power significantly impacts the performance of sensitive electronic equipment. These guidelines ensure that quality electrical power is provided to your data center. Voltage and frequency limits must be maintained to ensure proper functioning of your server.  A preliminary sizing for total power load can be obtained by adding the total power requirements for all devices to be connected.  These guidelines help to ensure that your data center has a quality power source. These dual-power installation configurations allow you to leverage the fully-redundant power features of your server.

 Power quality The quality of electrical power significantly impacts the performance of sensitive electronic equipment. These guidelines ensure that quality electrical power is provided to your data center.  equipment can tolerate some power disturbances or transients. However, large disturbances can cause equipment power failures or errors. Transients can come into the site on the power utility company lines but are often caused by electrical equipment installed in the building. For example, transients can be produced by welders, cranes, motors, induction heaters, elevators, copy machines, and other office equipment. The best way to prevent problems caused by power disturbances is to have transient-producing equipment on a separate power service than the one that supplies power to your information technology equipment.                     Ground or earthWhen used in reference to electrical power systems, Ground is a conducting connection between an electrical circuit and the earth or some conducting body that serves in place of the earth. The term ground is the most common name used, however it is also referred to as earth or terra in several international geographies. In this topic, these terms and other local language equivalents are interchangeable. Ground is a critical component of an electrical power distribution system. A properly installed ground system allows for safe operation of equipment that is connected to the electrical power source under normal and electrical or equipment fault conditions. The life safety function of ground and grounding methods is addressed by the appropriate local and national electrical wiring codes. In the United States, this code is known as the National Electric Code or publication 70 of the National Fire Protection Association. Many countries have adopted the National Electric Code or have developed an equivalent code. The National Electric Code and  its equivalents have a primary objective to provide safe operation of electrical power distribution systems and electrical equipment installations. Compliance with these codes does not guarantee efficient operation of equipment connected to the power distribution systems. When sensitive electronic equipment is connected, there are often times when additional ground connections may be required. Typically, additional ground connections are recommended when there is a concern for high frequency or radio frequency (RF) interference, which may impact electronic circuits. These additional ground requirements will be found with the installation documentation for specific equipment. Additional ground requirements may also be recommendations from engineering or data center evaluations, reviews or surveys. Local or national codes allow for these additional grounds to be installed.   Grounding equipment, unless double insulated, has power cords containing an insulated grounding conductor (color-coded green or green with yellow stripe) that connects the frame of the equipment to the ground terminal at the power receptacle. The power receptacles for  equipment are identified in the equipment documentation and should match the equipment power plug. In some cases, there may be options for different manufacturer equivalent receptacles.  equipment plugs should not be changed or altered to match existing connectors or receptacles. To do so may create a safety hazard and void product warranty. The connectors or receptacles for  equipment should be installed to a branch circuit with an equipment grounding conductor, connected to the grounding bus bar in the branch-circuit distribution panel. The grounding bus bar in the panel should then be connected back to the service entrance or suitable building ground by an equipment grounding conductor. Information technology equipment must be properly grounded. It is recommended that an insulated green wire ground, the same size as the phase wire, be installed between the branch circuit panel and the receptacle. For personnel safety, the ground must have sufficiently low impedance to limit the voltage to ground and to facilitate the operation of protective devices in the circuit. For example, the ground path shall not exceed 1 ohm for 120-volt, 20-ampere branch circuit devices.  The ground path impedance limit is 0.5 ohms for 120 volt branch circuits protected by 30 ampere circuit breakers. The limit is 0.1 ohms for 120 volt 60 to 100 ampere circuits. All grounds entering the room should be interconnected somewhere within the building to provide a common ground potential. This includes any separate power sources, lighting and convenience outlets, and other grounded objects, such as building steel, plumbing, and duct work.  The equipment grounding conductor must be electrically attached to both the enclosure of the computer power center and the connector grounding terminal. Conduit must not be used as the only grounding means, and it must be connected in parallel with any grounding conductors it contains. Transient grounding To minimize the effects of high-frequency electrical noise, the branch circuit power panel servicing the equipment should be mounted in contact with bare building steel or connected to it by a short length of cable. If this is not possible, a metal area of at least 1 m2 (10 ft2) in contact with masonry can be used. The plate should be connected to the green-conductor common. The preferred connection is with a braided strap. If a braided strap is not available, the connection should consist of no. 12 AWG (3.3 mm or 0.0051 in.) or larger conductor and should not be more than 1.5 m (5 ft) long. To minimize this length, the preferred connection of this braided strap or conductor is to the nearest portion of the enclosure on the panel, if the enclosure is electrically continuous from the green-conductor common point to this point of connection.    The raised-floor-supporting substructure can be used as a substitute for the transient plate if the structure has a consistently low-impedance path. If the raised floor has stringers or other subframing that makes electrical connection between the pedestals, the floor itself can be used for the signal reference plane. Some raised floors are stringerless and the floor tiles lock into isolated pedestals by gravity alone. If there is no reliable electrical connection between the pedestals, a signal reference grid can be constructed by connecting the pedestals together with conductors. A minimal grid would interconnect every other pedestal in the immediate area of the power panel and extend at least 3 m (10 ft) in all directions. Stranded bare or insulated conductor of at least no. 8 AWG (8 mm or 0.0124 in.) copper is required. This conductor provides a low-impedance path and is strong enough to make physical damage unlikely. Any connection method is acceptable as long as it provides a reliable electrical and mechanical connection.    A customer's self-contained, separately derived power system (computer power centers, transformers, motor generators), installed on a raised floor, has the same requirements.    Power specificationsYour server is normally furnished with power-supply provision to meet the 50-Hz or 60-Hz voltage standards shown in the following tables, respectively.

 Voltage and frequency limits Voltage and frequency limits must be maintained to ensure proper functioning of your server.  The phase-to-phase steady-state voltage must be maintained within plus six percent to minus 10 percent of the normal rated voltage, measured at the receptacle when the system is operating. A voltage surge or sag condition must not exceed plus 15 percent or minus 18 percent of the nominal voltage and must return to within a steady-state tolerance of plus 6 percent or minus 10 percent of normal rated voltage within 0.5 second.   Some servers might require special considerations and might have more or less restrictive specifications. See the individual server specifications for actual requirements. Because of the possibility of brownouts (planned voltage reduction by the utility company) or other marginal voltage conditions, installing a voltage monitor might be advisable.   The phase frequency must be maintained at 50 or 60 Hz + 0.5 Hz.   The value of any of the three phase-to-phase equipment voltages in the three-phase system must not differ by more than 2.5 percent from the arithmetic average of the three voltages. All three line-to-line voltages must be within the limits specified above.   The maximum total harmonic content of the power system voltage waveforms on the equipment feeder must not exceed 5 percent with the equipment operating. Parent topic:          
 Power load A preliminary sizing for total power load can be obtained by adding the total power requirements for all devices to be connected.  For a more precise analysis of power distribution system requirements, you can request   System Power Profile Program printout from your seller. The System Power Profile Program, controlled and operated by the service office installation planning representative, provides a vector analysis rather than an arithmetic summation of total power. The vector analysis takes into consideration power factor and phase relationships. In addition, it considers waveform distortions caused by the load and inrush requirements. Additional capacity should be planned for future expansion. Contact you service office installation planning representative for information on how to obtain a System Power Profile. Primary power problem areasYour server is designed to operate on the normal power supplied by most electrical utility companies. However, possible computer malfunctions can be caused by outside (radiated or conducted) transient electrical noise signals being superimposed on the power line to the computer. To guard against this interference, power distribution design should comply with the specifications discussed in this topic. Failures caused by the power source are basically of three types:   Power line disturbances, such as, short duration dips in voltage as well as prolonged outages. If the frequency of such power failures is not acceptable for your operation, installing standby or buffered power might be necessary.  Transient electrical noise superimposed on power lines might be caused by a variety of industrial, medical, communication, or other equipment:   Within the computing facilities  Adjacent to the computing facilities In the vicinity of the power company's distribution lines Switching large electrical loads can cause problems, even though the source is on a different branch circuit. If you suspect such a condition, it might be advisable to provide a separate, dedicated feeder or transformer for your server directly from your power source. If the transient-producing devices have been eliminated from the feeder and the computer room power panel and power line disturbances are still present, it might be necessary for you to install isolation equipment (for example, transformers, motor generators, or other power conditioning equipment).   Lightning protectionInstalling lightning protection devices is recommended on the computer power source when:      The primary power is supplied by an overhead power service. The utility company installs lightning protectors on the primary power source. The area is subject to electrical storms or an equivalent type of power surge. Lightning protection for communication wiringBe sure to install lightning protection devices to protect communication wiring and equipment from surges and transients induced into the communication wiring. In any area subject to lightning, surge suppressors should be installed at each end of every outdoor cable installation, whether installed above the ground (aerial) or buried below the ground.  Information about lightning surge suppressors for communication wiring systems and recommended installation methods for outdoor communication cables can be found in the manuals for the specific type of data processing system that is being considered.

 Power source These guidelines help to ensure that your data center has a quality power source. The primary power source is normally a wye-type or delta-type, three-phase service coming from a service entrance or a separately derived source with appropriate overcurrent protection and suitable ground (service entrance or building ground). A three-phase, five-wire power distribution system should be provided for flexibility in your data processing installation. However, depending on the type of equipment installed, a single-phase distribution system might be sufficient. The five wire system enables you to provide power for three-phase line-to-line, single phase line-to-line, and single phase line-to-Neutral. The five wires consist of three phase conductors, one neutral conductor, and one insulated equipment grounding conductor (green, or green with yellow trace).  Conduit must not be used as the only grounding means.   Power panel feedersEnsure that the feeder wires to the branch-circuit distribution panel (shown in Power quality) are large enough to handle the total server power load. It is recommended that these feeders service no other loads.   Branch circuitsThe computer branch circuit panel should be in an unobstructed, well-lighted area in the computer room.    The individual branch circuits on the panel should be protected by suitable circuit breakers properly rated according to manufacturer specifications and applicable codes. Each circuit breaker should be labeled to identify the branch circuit it is controlling. The receptacle should also be labeled.    Where a branch circuit and receptacle are installed to service your server, it is recommended that the grounding conductor of the branch circuit be insulated and equal in size to the phase conductors. The grounding conductor is an insulated, dedicated-equipment-grounding conductor, not the neutral.    Branch circuit receptacles installed under a raised floor should be within 0.9 m (3 ft) of the server that they supply power to. If the branch circuits are contained in a metallic conduit, either rigid or nonrigid, the conduit system should be grounded. This is accomplished by bonding the conduit to the power distribution panel, which in turn, is tied to the building or transformer ground.    Power cords are supplied in 4.3 m (14 ft) lengths unless otherwise noted in the server specifications. The length is measured from the exit symbol on the plan views. Some power plugs furnished by your seller are watertight, and should be located under the computer room raised floor. Phase rotationThe three-phase power receptacles for some equipment, such as printers, must be wired for correct phase rotation. When looking at the face of the receptacle and counting clockwise from the ground pin, the sequence is phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3. Emergency power controlA disconnecting means should be provided to disconnect the power from all electronic equipment in the computer room. This disconnecting means should be controlled from locations readily accessible to the operator at the principal exit doors. A similar disconnecting means to disconnect the air conditioning system serving this area should be available. Consult the local and national codes to determine the requirements for your installation. National Electric Code (NFPA 70) article 645 provides the requirements for this room EPO. See Emergency planning for continuous operations. Convenience outletsA suitable number of convenience outlets should be installed in the computer room and the Service Representative area for use by building maintenance personnel and service representatives. Convenience outlets should be on the lighting or other building circuits, not on the computer power panel or feeder. Under no circumstances are the service convenience outlets on your servers to be used for any purpose other than normal servicing. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related information:         
 Dual-power installation configurations These dual-power installation configurations allow you to leverage the fully-redundant power features of your server. Some  models are designed with a fully redundant power system. The possible power installation configurations are: This configuration requires that the system receives power from two separate power distribution panels.  This configuration requires that the system receives power from two separate power distribution panels. This configuration requires that the system receives power from two separate circuit breakers in a single power panel. Parent topic:          
 Dual-power installation: Redundant distribution panel and switch This configuration requires that the system receives power from two separate power distribution panels.  Each distribution panel receives power from a separate piece of building switch gear. This level of redundancy is not available in most facilities. Parent topic:          
 Dual-power installation: Redundant distribution panel This configuration requires that the system receives power from two separate power distribution panels.  The two distribution panels receive power from the same piece of building switch gear. Most facilities should be able to achieve this level of redundancy. Parent topic:          
 Single distribution panel: Dual circuit breakers This configuration requires that the system receives power from two separate circuit breakers in a single power panel.

 Temperature and humidity recording instruments Temperature and humidity recording instruments should be installed to provide a continuous record of the environmental conditions.  Direct-reading instruments with seven-day charts are suggested to monitor the ambient room conditions. Any under-floor air conditioning supply should also be monitored.    Monitoring provides the ability to:     Assure the air conditioning system is continuously performing as designed. Determine whether a mandatory drying-out period is necessary when the humidity limitations are exceeded. The duration of the drying-out period is determined by the extent and duration of excess humidity. Determine whether a mandatory warm-up period is necessary when the building temperature has dropped below server operating specifications during off-shift hours. A visual or audible signal should be incorporated with the recording instrument to alert personnel that ambient conditions are approaching the maximum limitations. Parent topic:          
 Relocation and temporary storage Shipment or storage conditions that exceed the specified limits can cause permanent damage to your server. These guidelines should be followed when relocating or temporarily storing your server.  Care should be taken to ensure that a server is not stored with chemicals that can cause corrosion damage.    When a server is removed in preparation for shipment or storage, use the packaging bill of material. This might include a protective package, including blocks, braces, and preparation instructions, designed uniquely for each server.   large processors are designed for operation in a controlled temperature and relative humidity range, and require the environment be kept within this range even when they are in a storage area or in transit. See the individual server specifications for operating environment limits. Shipment of large processors should be in an environmentally controlled van with appropriate strapping and padding to avoid any transit damage. Properties Shipping environment Temperature -40Â°C - 60Â°C (-40Â°F - 140Â°F) Relative humidity 5% to 100% (no condensation) Maximum wet bulb 1Â°C - 27Â°C (33.8Â°F - 80.6Â°F) If shipping a large processor in a nonenvironmentally controlled van, contact your seller for packing and unpacking instructions. Properties Storage environment Temperature 1Â°C - 60Â°C (33.8Â°F - 140Â°F) Relative humidity 5% - 80% Maximum wet bulb 1Â°C - 29Â°C (33.8Â°F - 84.2Â°F) Parent topic:          
 Planning for the installation of rear door heat exchangers Use this information to prepare your location to facilitate the use of the  rear door heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is a water-cooled device that is mounted on the rear of  rack to cool the air that is heated and exhausted by devices inside the rack. A supply hose delivers chilled, conditioned water to the heat exchanger. A return hose delivers warmed water back to the water pump or chiller. In this document, this is referred to as a secondary cooling loop. The primary cooling loop supplies the building chilled water to secondary cooling loops, air conditioning units, and so on. The hoses for the secondary cooling loop are not included with this product. The rack on which you install the heat exchanger can be on a raised floor or a non-raised floor. For heat exchanger performance information, see Heat exchanger performance. For information about hoses, water treatment, and cooling distribution units for supplying conditioned water, see Secondary cooling loop parts and services information. If you want to procure IBM installation planning services regarding what is needed to plan for supplying conditioned water and installing the rear door heat exchangers, see Secondary cooling loop parts and services information. Planning considerations overviewAs you plan the installation of the heat exchanger, include the following considerations:Providing chilled, conditioned water that meets the specifications that are outlined in .  Procuring and installing the water supply system that is suitable for your data center. Details are provided in .  Providing redundant secondary cooling loop water supply, or enough room air conditioning to handle a tolerable heat load if the function of one or more of the heat exchangers is compromised. If the rear door is opened for rack maintenance, or conditioned water supply to the door is stopped, the rack heat load is sent out into the room and must be handled by room air conditioning. This will occur until the conditioned water supply is restored.  Providing floor or ceiling tile cutouts or protective coverings to avoid tripping hazards on non-raised floors as part of hose management. Water control and conditioning of the secondary cooling loopIt is very important that the water that is being supplied to the heat exchanger meet the requirements that are described in this section. Otherwise, system failures might occur over time, as a result of any of the following problems:Leaks due to corrosion and pitting of the metal components of the heat exchanger or the water-supply system.  Buildup of scale deposits inside the heat exchanger, which can cause the following problems:A reduction of the ability of the heat exchanger to cool the air that is exhausted from the rack. Failure of mechanical hardware, such as a hose quick-connect coupling. Organic contamination, such as bacteria, fungi, or algae. This contamination can cause the same problems as described for scale deposits. The water that is used to fill, refill, and supply the heat exchanger must be particle-free deionized water or particle-free distilled water with appropriate controls for avoiding these issuesMetal corrosion Bacterial fouling Scaling The water cannot originate from the primary chilled-water system for the building but must be supplied as part of a secondary, closed-loop system.   Do not use glycol solutions because they can adversely affect the cooling performance of the heat exchanger. Water delivery specifications for secondary loopsThis section describes the various hardware components that make up the delivery system secondary loop that provides the chilled, conditioned water to the heat exchanger. The delivery system includes pipes, hoses, and the required connection hardware to connect to the heat exchanger. Hose management in raised floor or non-raised-floor environments is also described. The primary cooling loop is considered to be the building chilled-water supply or a modular chiller unit. The primary loop must not be used as a direct source of coolant for the heat exchanger for the following reasons: If the supply water temperature is below the room dew point, condensation forms and causes dripping from the door components.  If a leak develops in the door, supply hose, or return hose, a large amount of water is available. Procurement and installation of the components that are needed to create the secondary cooling loop system are required for this design and are your responsibility. See Secondary cooling loop parts and services information for information about suppliers of hoses and cooling distribution units.  The overpressure safety device must meet the following requirements:Comply with .  Perform a search for ISO 4126-1. Be installed so that it is easily accessed for inspection, maintenance, and repair. Be connected as close as possible to the device that it is intended to protect. Be adjustable only wi
