 Beginning troubleshooting and problem analysis This information provides a starting point for analyzing problems. This information is the starting point for diagnosing and repairing servers. From this point, you are guided to the appropriate information to help you diagnose server problems, determine the appropriate repair action, and then perform the necessary steps to repair the server. A system attention light, an enclosure fault light, or a system information light indicates there is a serviceable event (an SRC in the control panel or in one of the serviceable event views) on the system. This information guides you through finding the serviceable event. You can view and print a PDF of this information. You can use problem analysis to gather information that helps you determine the nature of a problem encountered on your system. This information is used to determine if you can resolve the problem yourself or to gather sufficient information to communicate with a service provider and quickly determine the service action that needs to be taken. This is the starting point for repair actions. All repair actions must begin with this procedure. From this point, you are guided to the appropriate information to help you perform the necessary steps to repair the server. The problem determination reference information is provided as an additional resource for problem detection and analysis when you are directed here by your service representative.         
 Beginning problem analysis You can use problem analysis to gather information that helps you determine the nature of a problem encountered on your system. This information is used to determine if you can resolve the problem yourself or to gather sufficient information to communicate with a service provider and quickly determine the service action that needs to be taken. The method of finding and collecting error information depends on the state of the hardware at the time of the failure. This procedure directs you to one of the following places to find error information:The  error logs The operating system's error log The control panel The  The Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) error logs Light path diagnostics If you are using this information because of a problem with your  (), see .

 Import Service Key Before you can import a service key file into an HMC, a service key file must first be created on the Kerberos server for the HMC host. The service key file contains the host principal of the HMC client, for example, host/example.com@EXAMPLE.COM. In addition to KDC Authentication, the host service key file is used to enable password-less SSH (Secure Shell) login using GSSAPI.  For MIT Kerberos V5 *nix distributions, create a service key file by running the kadmin utility on a KDC and using the ktadd command. Other Kerberos implementations may require a different process to create a service key. To import a service key: Open the KDC Configuration task from the HMC Management work pane. From the Actions drop down list, select Import Service Key. Select from one of the following:Local - The service key must be located on removable media currently mounted on the HMC. You must use this option locally at the HMC (not remotely), and you must mount the removable media to the HMC before using this option. Specify the full path of the service key file on the media.  Remote - The service key must be located on a remote site available to the HMC via secure FTP. You can import a service key file from any remote site that has SSH (Secure Shell) installed and running.

 KDC Configuration View the key distribution center (KDC) servers that are used by this HMC for Kerberos remote authentication.  From this task you can do the following:View existing KDC servers Modify existing KDC server parameters including realm, ticket lifetime, and clock skew Add and configure a KDC server on the HMC Remove a KDC server Import a service key Remove a service key Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. Under Kerberos, a client (generally either a user or a service) sends a request for a ticket to the KDC. The KDC creates a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for the client, encrypts it using the client's password as the key, and sends the encrypted TGT back to the client. The client then attempts to decrypt the TGT, using its password. If the client successfully decrypts the TGT (i.e., if the client gave the correct password), it keeps the decrypted TGT, which indicates proof of the client's identity. The tickets have a time availability period. Kerberos requires the clocks of the involved hosts to be synchronized. If the HMC clock is not synchronized with the clock of KDC server, authentication will fail. A Kerberos realm is an administrative domain, site, or logical network that uses Kerberos remote authentication. Each realm uses a master Kerberos database that is stored on a KDC server and that contains information about the users and services for that realm. A realm might also have one or more slave KDC servers, which store read-only copies of the master Kerberos database for that realm. To prevent KDC spoofing, the HMC can be configured to use a service key to authenticate to the KDC. Service key files are also known as keytabs. Kerberos verifies the TGT requested was issued by the same KDC that issued the service key file for the HMC. Before you can import a service key file into an HMC, you must generate a service key for the host principal of the HMC client.  Note: For MIT Kerberos V5 *nix distributions, create a service key file by running the kadmin utility on a KDC and using the ktadd command. Other Kerberos implementations may require a different process to create a service key. You can import a service key file from one of these sources: Removable media that is currently mounted to the HMC, such as optical discs or USB Mass Storage devices. You must use this option locally at the HMC (not remotely), and you must mount the removable media to the HMC before using this option. A remote site using secure FTP. You can import a service-key file from any remote site that has SSH installed and running.     To use Kerberos remote authentication for this HMC, complete the following:You must enable the Network Time Protocol (NTP) service on the HMC and set the HMC and the KDC servers to synchronize time with the same NTP server. You can enable the NTP service on the HMC by accessing the  task under HMC Management.  You must set the user profile of each remote user to use Kerberos remote authentication instead of local authentication. A user that is set to use Kerberos remote authentication will always use Kerberos remote authentication, even when the user logs onto the HMC locally.  You do not need to set all users to use Kerberos remote authentication. You can set some user profiles so that the users can use local authentication only. Use of a service key file is optional. Before using a service key file, you must import it into the HMC. If a service key is installed on the HMC, realm names must be equivalent to the network domain name. The following is an example of creating the service key file on a Kerberos server using the kadmin.local command assuming the HMC hostname is hmc1, the DNS domain is example.com, and the Kerberos realm name is EXAMPLE.COM:  # kadmin_local kadmin.local:  ktadd -k /etc/krb5.keytab host/hmc1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM Using the Kerberos ktutil on the Kerberos server, verify the service key file contents. The output should look like the following:# ktutil  ktutil:  rkt /etc/krb5.keytab  ktutil:  l  slot KVNO Principal ---- ---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------    1    9      host/hmc1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM     2    9      host/hmc1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM  The HMC Kerberos configuration can be modified for SSH (Secure Shell) login without a password using GSSAPI. For remote login without a password through Kerberos to an HMC, configure the HMC to use a service key. Once the configuration is completed use kinit -f  principal to obtain forwardable credentials on a remote Kerberos client machine. Then issue the following command to log in to the HMC without having to enter a password:  $ ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=gssapi-with-mic user@host Display existing KDC servers on the HMC. Add a Key Distribution Center (KDC) server to this HMC. Kerberos authentication on the HMC remains enabled until all KDC servers are removed. Before you can import a service key file into an HMC, a service key file must first be created on the Kerberos server for the HMC host. The service key file contains the host principal of the HMC client, for example, host/example.com@EXAMPLE.COM. In addition to KDC Authentication, the host service key file is used to enable password-less SSH (Secure Shell) login using GSSAPI. Parent topic:

 Manage User Profiles and Access Manage your system users that log on to the HMC. A user profile is a combination of a user ID, server authentication method, permissions, and a text description. Permissions represent the authority levels assigned to the user profile for the objects the user has permission to access. Users can be authenticated using local authentication on the HMC, by using Kerberos remote authentication, or by using LDAP authentication. For more information on setting up Kerberos authentication on the HMC, see . For more information about LDAP authentication, see .  If you are using local authentication, the user ID and password are used to verify a userâs authorization to log on the HMC. The user ID must start with an alphabetic character and consist of 1 to 32 characters. The password has the following rules:  Must begin with an alphanumeric character. Must contain at least seven characters, however, this limit may be changed by your system administrator. The characters should be standard 7-bit ASCII characters. Valid characters to use for the password can be: A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and special characters (~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] \ : " ; â). If you are using Kerberos authentication, specify a Kerberos remote user ID. The user profile includes managed resource roles and task roles that are assigned to the user. The managed resource roles assign permissions for a managed object or group of objects and the task roles define the access level for a user to perform on a managed object or group of objects.

 Remote operations Connect to and use the HMC remotely. Remote operations use the GUI used by a local HMC operator or the command line interface (CLI) on the HMC. You can perform operations remotely in the following ways: Use a remote HMC Use a Web browser to connect to a local HMC Use an HMC remote command line The remote HMC is an HMC that is on a different subnet from the service processor, therefore the service processor cannot be auto discovered with IP multicast.  To determine whether to use a remote HMC or Web browser connected to a local HMC, consider the scope of control that you need. A remote HMC defines a specific set of managed objects that are directly controlled by the remote HMC, while a Web browser to a local HMC has control over the same set of managed objects as the local HMC. The communications connectivity and communications speed is an additional consideration; LAN connectivity provides acceptable communications for either a remote HMC or Web browser control.    A remote HMC gives the most complete set of functions because it is a complete HMC; only the process of configuring the managed objects is different from a local HMC.  If you need occasional monitoring and control of managed objects that are connected to a single local HMC, use a web browser. An example of using the web browser might be an off-hours monitor from home by an operator or system programmer. An alternative to performing tasks on the HMC graphical user interface is using the command line interface (CLI).  Learn about the requirements your web browser must meet to monitor and control the HMC. Perform the necessary steps to prepare to use a web browser to access the HMC. Log in to the HMC remotely from a LAN-connected web browser. Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Using a remote HMC A remote HMC gives the most complete set of functions because it is a complete HMC; only the process of configuring the managed objects is different from a local HMC.  As a complete HMC, a remote HMC has the same setup and maintenance requirements as a local Hardware Management Console. A remote HMC needs LAN TCP/IP connectivity to each managed object (service processor) that is to be managed; therefore, any customer firewall that may exist between the remote HMC and its managed objects must permit HMC to service processor communications to occur. A remote HMC may also need communication with another HMC for service and support.  shows the ports a remote HMC uses for communications. Port Use udp 9900 HMC to HMC discovery  tcp 9920 HMC to HMC commands A remote HMC needs connectivity to IBMÂ® (or another HMC that has connectivity to IBM) for service and support. The connectivity to IBM might be in the form of access to the Internet (through a company firewall), or a dialed connection through a customer-provided switched telephone connection that uses the supplied modem (see ). A remote HMC cannot use the supplied modem for communication with a local HMC or a service processor.  Performance and the availability of the status information and access to the control functions of the service processor depends on the reliability, availability, and responsiveness of the customer network that interconnects the remote HMC with the managed object. A remote HMC monitors the connection to each service processor and attempts to recover any lost connections and can report those connections that cannot be recovered.  Security for a remote HMC is provided by the HMC user-login procedures in the same way as a local HMC. As with a local HMC, all communication between a remote HMC and each service processor is encrypted. Certificates for secure communications are provided, and can be changed by the user if desired (see ).  TCP/IP access to the remote HMC is controlled through its internally managed firewall and is limited to HMC related functions.  Parent topic:

 Using a web browser If you need occasional monitoring and control of managed objects that are connected to a single local HMC, use a web browser. An example of using the web browser might be an off-hours monitor from home by an operator or system programmer. Each HMC contains a web server that can be configured to allow remote access for a specified set of users. If a customer firewall exists between the web browser and the local HMC, the ports must be accessible and the firewall setup to allow incoming requests on these ports.  shows the ports that a web browser needs for communicating with an HMC.  Port Use TCP 443 Secure browser access to web server communication TCP 8443 Secure browser access to web server communication TCP 9960 Browser applet communication TCP 124431 Remote web browser communication 1This port is opened in the HMC firewall when remote access is enabled in HMC Version 7.8.0 and later. This port must also be opened in any firewall that is between the remote client and the HMC. After the HMC is configured to allow web browser access, a web browser gives an enabled user access to all the configured functions of a local HMC, except those functions that require physical access to the HMC, such as those that use the local diskette or DVD media. The user interface that is presented to the remote web browser user is the same as that of the local HMC and is subject to the same constraints as the local HMC.  The web browser can be connected to the local HMC by using a LAN TCP/IP connection and using only encrypted (HTTPS) protocols. Logon security for a web browser is provided by the HMC user-login procedures. Certificates for secure communications are provided, and can be changed by the user (see ).  Performance and the availability of the status information and access to the control functions of the managed objects depends on the reliability, availability, and responsiveness of the network that interconnects the web browser with the local HMC. Because there is no direct connection between the web browser and the individual managed objects, the web browser does not monitor the connection to each service processor, does not do any recovery, and does not report any lost connections. These functions are handled by the local HMC  The web browser system does not require connectivity to IBMÂ® for service or support. Maintenance of the browser and system level is the responsibility of the customer. If the URL of the HMC is specified using the format https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address) and Microsoft Internet Explorer is used as the browser, a hostname mismatch message is displayed. To avoid this message, a Firefox browser is used or a hostname is configured for the HMC, using the Change Network Settings task (see ), and this hostname is specified in the URL instead of an IP address. For example, you can use the format https://hostname.domain_name or https://hostname (for example, using https://hmc1.ibm.com or https://hmc1). Parent topic:          
 Using the HMC remote command line An alternative to performing tasks on the HMC graphical user interface is using the command line interface (CLI).  You can use the command line interface in the following situations: When consistent results are required. If you have to administer several managed systems, you can achieve consistent results by using the command line interface. The command sequence can be stored in scripts and run remotely. When automated operations are required. After you have developed a consistent way to manage the managed systems, you can automate the operations by invoking the scripts from batch-processing applications, such as the cron daemon, from other systems. On a local HMC, you can use the command line interface in a terminal window. To open a terminal window, use the Open Restricted Shell Terminal task from the HMC Management work pane. You must ensure that your script executions between SSH clients and the HMC are secure. You can enable or disable the remote command line interface access to the HMC. Parent topic:          
 Setting up secure script execution between SSH clients and the HMC You must ensure that your script executions between SSH clients and the HMC are secure. HMCs typically are placed inside the machine room where managed systems are located, so you might not have physical access to the HMC. In this case, you can remotely access it using either a remote Web browser or the remote command line interface.   To enable scripts to run unattended between an SSH client and an HMC, the SSH protocol must already be installed on the client's operating system. To enable scripts to run unattended between an SSH client and an HMC, do the following: Enable remote command execution.  For more information, see  On the client's operating system, run the SSH protocol key generator. To run the SSH protocol key generator, do the following:To store the keys, create a directory named $HOME/.ssh (either RSA or DSA keys can be used). To generate public and private keys, run the following command:ssh-keygen -t  rsa The following files are created in the $HOME/.ssh directory:private key: id_rsa public  key: id_rsa.pub The write bits for both group and other are turned off. Ensure that the private key has a permission of 600. On the client's operating system, use ssh and run the mkauthkeys command to update the HMC user's authorized_keys2 file on the HMC by using the following command:ssh hmcuser@hmchostname âmkauthkeys -âadd '<the contents of $HOME/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub>' â â To delete the key from the HMC, can use the following command: ssh hmcuser@hmchostname âmkauthkeys --remove 'joe@somehost' â To enable password prompting for all hosts that access the HMC through ssh, use the scp command to copy the key file from the HMC: scp hmcuser@hmchostname:.ssh/authorized_keys2 authorized_keys2 Edit the authorized_keys2 file and remove all lines in this file. Then copy it back to the HMC: scp authorized_keys2 hmcuser@hmchostname:.ssh/authorized_keys2 Parent topic:

For LAN-based connections, know the TCP/IP address of the HMC to be controlled, and have correctly set up any firewall access between the HMC and the web browser.  Have a valid user ID and password assigned by the access administrator for HMC web access. Parent topic:          
 Logging in to the HMC from a LAN-connected web browser Log in to the HMC remotely from a LAN-connected web browser. Use the following steps to log in to the HMC from a LAN-connected web browser: Ensure that your web browser PC has LAN connectivity to the desired HMC. From your web browser, enter the URL of the desired HMC, using the format https://hostname.domain_name  (for example: https://hmc1.ibm.com) or https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.If this is the first access of the HMC for the current web browser session, you can receive a certificate error. This certificate error is displayed if: The web server contained in the HMC is configured to use a self-signed certificate and the browser has not been configured to trust the HMC as an issuer of certificates,  The HMC is configured to use a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) and the browser has not been configured to trust this CA. In either case, if you know that the certificate being displayed to the browser is the one used by the HMC, you can continue and all communications to the HMC will be encrypted.  If you do not want to receive notification of a certificate error for the first access of any browser session, you can configure the browser to trust the HMC or the CA. In general, to configure the browser, use one of the following methods:You must indicate that the browser will permanently trust the issuer of the certificate By viewing the certificate and installing, to the database of trusted CAs, the certificate of the CA that issued the certificate used by the HMC.    If the certificate is self-signed, the HMC itself is considered the CA that issued the certificate. When prompted, enter the user name and password assigned by your administrator.

 Managing Install Resources Add or remove operating environment installation resources for your HMC. You can use the HMC to deploy a system plan that contains information for installing one or more operating environments on one or more logical partitions. To install an operating environment as part of deploying a system plan, the HMC must be able to access and to use an installation resource for that operating environment.  An operating environment installation resource is the necessary set of installation files for a specific version of an operating environment at a specific release and modification level. The installation resource can be on the local hard drive for the HMC or it can be on a Network Installation Management (NIM) server that the HMC can access.  When you define and create a local installation resource, you must meet the following prerequisites: You can define only one local installation resource for a specific operating environment version and modification level.  The HMC must have enough free hard disk space for the necessary set of operating environment installation files. The HMC creates the installation resource in the same local hard drive location that the HMC uses for main store dumps. Consequently, it is recommended that you maintain a certain amount of free hard drive space to avoid potential main store dump problems because main store dumps are necessary to help resolve some types of HMC errors. The typical main store dump averages between 4 to 8 gigabytes (GB), so consider maintaining at least 10 GB of free hard drive space for these dumps when you define and create local installation resources for the HMC.  You must have the operating environment installation media available to copy to the HMC local hard drive. The type of media that you need varies based on the type of operating environment you want to be able to install. You can use CDs or DVDs as the installation image source for Red Hat and SLES operating environments. However, you can use DVDs only as the installation image source for  Virtual I/O Server operating environments.  When you define a remote NIM server installation resource, you must meet a number of prerequisite conditions to ensure that the HMC can access and use the installation resource: The complete set of necessary operating environment installation files must exist on the NIM server within a uniquely named NIM resource group.  You can define a remote resource for  Virtual I/O Server operating environments only.  You can define multiple remote installation resources for a specific operating environment version and modification level, as long as each installation resource is within a different NIM named resource group.  You must know the fully qualified host name of the NIM server. You must know the resource group name that contains the necessary set of operating environment installation files.  You must set up the HMC to be able to access the NIM server and use the operating environment installation files during system plan deployment. The HMC must be able to run secure shell commands by means of an ssh connection to access the NIM server successfully. Consequently, you must ensure that the HMC can provide an appropriate cryptographic key to the NIM server by completing the following steps: Open an HMC command prompt and run the following command to generate the RSA keys that the HMC needs for ssh connections and to place the keys in an accessible file in the HMC HOME directory: ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /home/hscroot/ssh_keys. This command creates two files: one called  and one called  that contain the needed RSA keys. The  file contains the private key that the HMC needs for establishing an ssh connection and this file needs to remain in the /home/hscroot subdirectory; the  file contains the public key that the NIM server must have to complete the ssh connection with the HMC.  On the remote NIM server, append or copy the content of the  file into the  file on the NIM server.   Remote clients defined on the NIM server remain in place after installation of the operating environment on a partition for post installation management. The short hostname of the system will identify this remote client.  Each installation resource that you define and create for the HMC is available for selection in the  step of the Deploy System Plan Wizard. If the installation resource that you want to use for a selected partition is not available when you perform this step, you can click New Install Resource to open the Manage Install Resources window to define and create a new installation resource.

For IPv6, there is no automatic discovery. For more information about how to configure the  as a DHCP server, see . This figure shows a redundant HMC environment with two managed systems. The first HMC is connected to the first port on each FSP, and the redundant HMC is connected to the second port on each HMC. Each HMC is configured as a DHCP server, using a different range of IP addresses. The connections are on separate private networks. As such, it is important to ensure that no FSP port is connected to more than one HMC. Each managed system's FSP port that is connected to an HMC requires a unique IP address. To ensure that each FSP has a unique IP address, use the HMC's built-in DHCP server capability. When the FSP detects the active network link, it issues a broadcast request to locate a DHCP server. When correctly configured, the HMC responds to that request by allocating one of a selected range of addresses.  If you have multiple FSPs, you must have your own LAN switch or hub for the HMC to FSP private network. Alternately, this private segment can exist as several ports in a private virtual LAN (VLAN) on a larger managed switch. If you have multiple private VLANs, you must ensure that they are isolated and that there is not any crossover traffic.  If you have more than one HMC, you must also connect each HMC to the logical partitions, and to each other, on the same open network. This figure shows two HMCs connected to a single managed server on the private network and to three logical partitions on the public network.

Remote users can access the  in the following ways: By using the Web browser to access all the  GUI functions remotely By using Secure Socket Shell (SSH) to access the  command line functions remotely Used to transmit data, such as hardware error reports, inventory data, and microcode updates, to and from your service provider. You can use this communications path to make automatic service calls. Your HMC can support up to four separate physical Ethernet interfaces, depending on the model. The stand-alone version of the HMC supports only three HMC interfaces, using one integrated Ethernet adapter and up to two plug-in adapters. Use each of these interfaces in the following ways:   Even though the network interfaces into the service processors are encrypted for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol and password-protected, having a separate dedicated network can provide a higher level of security for these interfaces. An open network interface would typically be used for the network connection between the  and the logical partitions on the managed systems, for the -to-logical partition communications. You can also use this open network interface to manage the HMC remotely. Optionally, you can use a third interface to connect to logical partitions and manage the HMC remotely. This interface can also be used as a separate  connection to different groups of logical partitions. For example, you might want to have an administrative LAN that is separate from the LAN on which all the usual business transactions are running. Remote administrators could access s and other managed units using this method. Sometimes the logical partitions are in different network security domains, perhaps behind a firewall, and you might want to have different  network connections into each of those two domains. Web browser requirements for HMCThe Hardware Management Console (HMC) is supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 6.0 and 7.0, Firefox version 1.5.0.7 and 2.0.

 Private and open networks in the HMC environment The HMC can be configured to use open and private networks. Private networks allow the use of a selected range of nonroutable IP-addresses. A public, or "open" network describes a network connection between the HMC to any logical partitions and to other systems on your regular network. Private networksThe only devices on the HMC private network are the HMC itself and each of the managed systems to which that HMC is connected. The HMC is connected to each managed system's FSP (Flexible Service Processor).  On most systems, the FSP provides two Ethernet ports labeled  and . This allows you to connect up to two HMCs.  Some systems have a dual-FSP option. In this situation, the second FSP acts as a "redundant" backup. The basic setup requirements for a system with two FSPs are essentially the same as those without a second FSP. The HMC must be connected to each FSP, so additional network hardware is required (for example, a LAN switch or hub) when there is more than one FSP or there are multiple managed systems.  Each FSP port on the managed system must be connected to only one HMC. Public networks The open network can be connected to a firewall or router for connecting to the Internet. Connecting to the Internet allows the HMC to "call home" when there are any hardware errors that need to be reported. The HMC itself provides its own firewall on each of its network interfaces. A basic firewall is automatically configured when you run the HMC Guided Setup wizard, but you customize your firewall settings after the initial HMC installation and configuration.

 Preparing for  configuration Use this section to gather required configuration settings that you need to know before you begin the configuration steps.  To configure the HMC, you must understand the related concepts, make decisions and prepare information. This section describes the information you will need to connect your HMC to the following:Service processors in your managed systems Logical partitions on those managed systems Remote workstations Service, to implement âcall-homeâ functions  Additional connectivity and security information is available. For more information, see   To prepare for HMC configuration, do the following: Obtain and install the latest level of the HMC code version you want to install.  Determine the physical location of the HMC in relation to the servers it will manage. If the HMC is more than 25 feet from its managed system, you must provide web browser access to the HMC from the managed system's location so that service personnel can access the HMC. Identify the servers that the HMC will manage. Determine whether you will use a private or an open network to manage servers.  If you decide to use a private network, use DHCP, unless you are using a Cluster Systems Management (CSM) configuration. CSM does not support IPv6. To access CSM, you must have two networks. For more information about CSM, see the documentation that was provided with that feature. For more information about private and open networks, see . If you will use an open network to manage an FSP, you must set the FSP's address manually through the Advanced System Management Interface menus. A private, non-routable network is recommended. If you have two HMCs, designate a primary and secondary HMC. The primary HMC should be physically closer to the machine, and should be the HMC that is configured to call home. Determine the network settings that you will need to connect the HMC to remote workstations, logical partitions, and network devices.  Define how the HMC will âcall home.â Call home options include either over an outbound-only Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Internet connection, a modem, or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection.

 Choosing an Internet Protocol Determine the IP address version used when the HMC connects to your service provider. Most users use Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) to connect to a service provider. IPv4 addresses appear in the format representing the four bytes of the IPv4 address, separated by periods (for example, 9.60.12.123) to access the Internet. You can also use Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) to connect to a service provider. IPv6 is often used by network administrators to ensure unique address space. If you are unsure of the Internet Protocol used by your installation, contact your network administrator. For more information about using each version, see  and .  Parent topic:

 Deciding which connectivity method to use for the call-home server Learn more about the connectivity options you have when you use the call-home server. You can configure the HMC to send hardware service related information to IBM by using a LAN-based Internet connection, or a dial-up connection over a modem.  You have two communication choices when configuring the LAN based Internet connection.  The first choice is to use standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The SSL communication can be enabled to connect to the Internet through your proxy server. SSL connectivity is more likely to be compliant with corporate security guidelines. Your second option is to use a VPN connection.  If your open network interface connection uses only Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), you cannot use Internet VPN to connect to support. For more information about the Protocols used, see . The advantages to using an Internet connection can include: Significantly faster transmission speed Reduced customer expense (for example, the cost of a dedicated analog telephone line) Greater reliability   The following security characteristics are in effect, regardless of the connectivity method chosen: Remote Support Facility requests are always initiated from the HMC to IBM. An inbound connection is never initiated from the IBMÂ® Service Support System. All data transferred between the HMC and the IBM Service Support System are encrypted using a high-grade encryption. Depending upon the connectivity method chosen, it is encrypted using either SSL or IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).  When initializing the encrypted connection the HMC authenticates the target destination as that of the IBM Service Support System. Data sent to the IBM Service Support System consists solely of information about hardware problems and configuration. No application or customer data is transmitted to IBM. Using an indirect Internet connection with a proxy serverIf your installation requires the HMC to be on a private network, you may be able to connect indirectly to the Internet using an SSL proxy, which can forward requests to the Internet. One of the other potential advantages of using an SSL proxy is that the proxy may support logging and audit facilities.  To forward SSL sockets, the proxy server must support the basic proxy header functions (as described in RFC 2616) and the CONNECT method. Optionally, basic proxy authentication (RFC 2617) may be configured so that the HMC authenticates before attempting to forward sockets through the proxy server.  For the HMC to communicate successfully, the client's proxy server must allow connections to port 443. You can configure your proxy server to limit the specific IP addresses to which the HMC can connect. See  for a list of IP addresses. Using a direct Internet SSL connectionIf your HMC can be connected to the Internet, and the external firewall can be set up to allow established TCP packets to flow outbound to the destinations described in ,  you can use a direct Internet connection.

 Internet SSL address lists Learn about the addresses the HMC uses when it is using Internet SSL connectivity. The HMC uses the following IPv4 addresses to contact IBM service and support when it is configured to use Internet SSL connectivity. The following IPv4 addresses are for all locations: 129.42.26.224 129.42.34.224 129.42.42.224 170.225.15.41 129.42.56.216 129.42.58.216 129.42.60.216 The following IPv4 addresses are for the Americas: 129.42.160.48 129.42.160.49 207.25.252.200 207.25.252.204 The following IPv4 addresses are for all locations other than the Americas: 129.42.160.48 129.42.160.50 207.25.252.200 207.25.252.205  When configuring a firewall to allow an HMC to connect to these servers, only the IP addresses specific to the geographic region are required.

 Using multiple call-home servers This topic describes what you need to know when you decide to use more than one call-home server. To avoid a single point of failure, configure the HMC to use multiple call-home servers. The first available call-home server attempts to handle each service event. If the connection or transmission fails with this call-home server, the service request is retried using the other available call-home servers until one is successful or all have been tried.  The connected HMC that has been identified by problem analysis to be the primary analyzing console for a given managed system will report the problem. This primary console will also replicate the problem report to any secondary HMC. This secondary HMC must be recognized on the network by the primary HMC. A secondary HMC is recognized by the primary HMC as an additional call-home server when:The primary HMC is configured to use "discovered" call-home servers and the call-home server is either on the same subnet as the primary HMC or it manages the same system The call-home server has been manually added to the list of call-home server consoles available for outbound connectivity Parent topic:

  or  The information provided in this topic defines specific sections of a location code string. Use this information to understand the meaning of a location code. Using location codesUse the following table to link to a specific topic that you need additional information about when reading your location code. Location code topics Description Contains background information on the use of location codes. Provides a definition for physical location code. Provides a definition of what a logical location code is. Provides descriptive information of the Un value in the location code string. For example, U789C.001.  Provides a table that identifies and defines the location code labels. The location code labels begin with an alphabetic character and follow the system serial number. For example, U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23. The system serial number is 10ABCDE in the previous example. P3, C31, T2, and L23 all contain an alphabetic character that is identified in the Location code labels table. Provides a definition for the world unique identifier. This group of digits follows the resource code labels and always begins with the letter W. Location code overviewServers (system unit and expansion units) use physical location codes to provide mapping of replaceable units. Location codes are produced by the server's firmware, which structures them so that they can be used to identify specific parts in a system. The location code format is the same for all servers. If you are working with a specific location code, the unit type and model immediately follow the first character (Utttt.mmm). Match the unit type and model to a link, as shown in the Unit type and locations table. If the location code ends with , the server's firmware could not identify the physical location. When a physical location cannot be identified, a logical location code is provided. Where logical location codes occur in enclosures, the locations topic for the enclosure has the known conversions listed. For logical location codes with no conversion, contact your next level of support. If the location code begins with , the expansion I/O unit's machine type, model, and serial number have not been set yet and this is a temporary unit identifier. To identify the unit, examine the display panels on all of the expansion I/O units that are connected to the server until you find one with the same characters in the first 5 digits of the top line in the unit's display. Record the unit's real machine type and model from the unit label.   Match the unit's machine type and model in the Unit type and locations table and follow the link to determine the service information.  Locations for units that are not in the preceding list are either not supported or there is a problem in the firmware. Contact your next level of support. Physical location codesPhysical location codes provide a mapping of logical functions and components (such as backplanes, removable modules, connectors, ports, cables, and devices) to their specific locations within the physical structure of the server. Logical location codesIf the physical location cannot be mapped to a physical location code, the server's firmware generates a logical location code. A logical location code is a sequence of location labels that identifies the path that the system uses to communicate with a given resource.  A resource has as many logical location codes as it has logical connections to the system. For example, an external tape device connected to two I/O adapters has two logical location codes. An example of a logical location code is: U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23 The first part of the location code (through the T2 label) represents the physical location code for the resource that communicates with the target resource. The remainder of the logical location code (L23) represents exactly which resource is indicated. Location code formatThe location code is an alphanumeric string of variable length, consisting of a series of location identifiers, separated by a dash.  An example of a physical location for a fan is Un-A1.  The first position, represented by Un (where n is equal to any string contained between the U and the hyphen) in the preceding example, is displayed in one of the forms in the following table.  In location codes the U is a constant digit; however, the numbered positions that follow the U are variables and are dependent on your server. Each column defines the numbers that follow the U in the beginning of the location code.  Machine type and model number in a location code Feature codes and sequence numbers in a location code  Utttt.mmm.sssssss-A1  Uffff.ccc.sssssss-A1 The leftmost code is always U. The leftmost code is always U. tttt represents the unit type of the enclosure (drawer or node). ffff represents the feature code of the enclosure (drawer or node). mmm represents the model of the enclosure. ccc represents the sequence number of the enclosure . sssssss represents the serial number for the enclosure. sssssss represents the serial number of the enclosure.   The mmm or ccc number might not be displayed on all location codes for all servers. If the mmm value is not displayed, the location code is displayed in one of the following forms: Utttt.sssssss-A1 Uffff.sssssss-A1 The location code is hierarchical; that is, each location identifier in the string represents a physical part. The order (from left to right), in which each identifier is shown, allows you to determine which parts contain other parts in the string. The dash (-) separator character represents a relationship between two components in the unit. In the example of the fan, whose location code is Un-A1, the dash shows that the fan (A1) is contained in the base unit (or Un). Modules, adapters, cables, and devices are all parts that are plugged into another part. Their location codes always show that they are plugged into another part as components of the server. Another example follows: Un-P1-C9 is a memory DIMM (C9) that is plugged into a backplane (P1), which is inside the unit (Un).  For devices, certain error conditions might cause an  device to display the device location in an  format. Unit type (Utttt.mmm) Link to location information U8202.E4B or U8205.E6B  or   Location code labelsThe location code label represents a physical part of the server. The following table describes the prefixes of location code labels.  These labels apply to system units only. Prefix Description Example A Air-moving device Fan, blower C Card connector IOP, IOA, DIMM, processor card D Device Diskette, control panel E Electrical Battery, power supply, ac charger L Logical path SAS target Integrated drive electronics (IDE) address, Fibre Channel LUN N Horizontal placement for an empty rack location Â  P Planar System backplane T Port, external cable Â  U Unit Â  V Virtual planar Â  W Worldwide unique ID Â  X EIA value for an empty rack location Â  Y Firmware FRU Â  Worldwide unique identifierThe location code label for the worldwide unique identifier consists of the prefix W followed by a maximum of 16 uppercase hexadecimal digits with no leading zeros. A location code might not consist of a worldwide unique identifier. When present, the worldwide unique identifier location label follows the location label of the resource that interfaces with the resource that has the worldwide unique identifier, usually a port.

Isolating a PCI bus problem from the management console To isolate a PCI bus problem from the management console, check the serviceable event view for the server for FRU part locations associated with the serviceable event, then continue with this procedure:   Use those locations to exchange the given FRUs one at a time until the problem is resolved.   Continue with the next step.     Continue with the next step.  The multi-adapter bridge number and the multi-adapter function number have not been identified, and so the card slot cannot be identified using the DSA. Look in the management console partition resources for non-reporting or non-operational hardware. That will indicate which cards in which positions need to be replaced. See  for the model you are working on for information about the multi-adapter bridge that controls those card slots. That multi-adapter bridge is also a FRU.    Continue with the next step.  Only the multi-adapter bridge number has been identified. Record the multi-adapter bridge number (left-most character of Cc) for later use. Because the card slot cannot be identified with the DSA, see   for the model you are working on for information about the multi-adapter bridge that controls the card slots. Consider all card slots controlled by the multi-adapter bridge to be FRUs.   Then return to the procedure that sent you here.          
 MABIP52 This procedure will isolate a failing PCI adapter from a reference code when an IPL is not successful on the system or logical partition.  Power off the partition to remove and replace any failing items referenced in this procedure. If you do not perform dedicated maintenance, the problem will persist.

  or  The information provided in this topic defines specific sections of a location code string. Use this information to understand the meaning of a location code. Using location codesUse the following table to link to a specific topic that you need additional information about when reading your location code. Location code topics Description Contains background information on the use of location codes. Provides a definition for physical location code. Provides a definition of what a logical location code is. Provides descriptive information of the Un value in the location code string. For example, U789C.001.  Provides a table that identifies and defines the location code labels. The location code labels begin with an alphabetic character and follow the system serial number. For example, U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23. The system serial number is 10ABCDE in the previous example. P3, C31, T2, and L23 all contain an alphabetic character that is identified in the Location code labels table. Provides a definition for the world unique identifier. This group of digits follows the resource code labels and always begins with the letter W. Location code overviewServers (system unit and expansion units) use physical location codes to provide mapping of replaceable units. Location codes are produced by the server's firmware, which structures them so that they can be used to identify specific parts in a system. The location code format is the same for all servers. If you are working with a specific location code, the unit type and model immediately follow the first character (Utttt.mmm). Match the unit type and model to a link, as shown in the Unit type and locations table. If the location code ends with , the server's firmware could not identify the physical location. When a physical location cannot be identified, a logical location code is provided. Where logical location codes occur in enclosures, the locations topic for the enclosure has the known conversions listed. For logical location codes with no conversion, contact your next level of support. If the location code begins with , the expansion I/O unit's machine type, model, and serial number have not been set yet and this is a temporary unit identifier. To identify the unit, examine the display panels on all of the expansion I/O units that are connected to the server until you find one with the same characters in the first 5 digits of the top line in the unit's display. Record the unit's real machine type and model from the unit label.   Match the unit's machine type and model in the Unit type and locations table and follow the link to determine the service information.  Locations for units that are not in the preceding list are either not supported or there is a problem in the firmware. Contact your next level of support. Physical location codesPhysical location codes provide a mapping of logical functions and components (such as backplanes, removable modules, connectors, ports, cables, and devices) to their specific locations within the physical structure of the server. Logical location codesIf the physical location cannot be mapped to a physical location code, the server's firmware generates a logical location code. A logical location code is a sequence of location labels that identifies the path that the system uses to communicate with a given resource.  A resource has as many logical location codes as it has logical connections to the system. For example, an external tape device connected to two I/O adapters has two logical location codes. An example of a logical location code is: U789C.001.10ABCDE-P3-C31-T2-L23 The first part of the location code (through the T2 label) represents the physical location code for the resource that communicates with the target resource. The remainder of the logical location code (L23) represents exactly which resource is indicated. Location code formatThe location code is an alphanumeric string of variable length, consisting of a series of location identifiers, separated by a dash.  An example of a physical location for a fan is Un-A1.  The first position, represented by Un (where n is equal to any string contained between the U and the hyphen) in the preceding example, is displayed in one of the forms in the following table.  In location codes the U is a constant digit; however, the numbered positions that follow the U are variables and are dependent on your server. Each column defines the numbers that follow the U in the beginning of the location code.  Machine type and model number in a location code Feature codes and sequence numbers in a location code  Utttt.mmm.sssssss-A1  Uffff.ccc.sssssss-A1 The leftmost code is always U. The leftmost code is always U. tttt represents the unit type of the enclosure (drawer or node). ffff represents the feature code of the enclosure (drawer or node). mmm represents the model of the enclosure. ccc represents the sequence number of the enclosure . sssssss represents the serial number for the enclosure. sssssss represents the serial number of the enclosure.   The mmm or ccc number might not be displayed on all location codes for all servers. If the mmm value is not displayed, the location code is displayed in one of the following forms: Utttt.sssssss-A1 Uffff.sssssss-A1 The location code is hierarchical; that is, each location identifier in the string represents a physical part. The order (from left to right), in which each identifier is shown, allows you to determine which parts contain other parts in the string. The dash (-) separator character represents a relationship between two components in the unit. In the example of the fan, whose location code is Un-A1, the dash shows that the fan (A1) is contained in the base unit (or Un). Modules, adapters, cables, and devices are all parts that are plugged into another part. Their location codes always show that they are plugged into another part as components of the server. Another example follows: Un-P1-C9 is a memory DIMM (C9) that is plugged into a backplane (P1), which is inside the unit (Un).  For devices, certain error conditions might cause an  device to display the device location in an  format.

 Planning for logical partitions You can create logical partitions to distribute resources within a single server and make it function as if it were two or more independent servers. Before creating logical partitions, you must assess your current and future needs. You can then use this information to determine the hardware configuration that will meet your current needs and serve as a base for meeting your future needs.  Planning for logical partitions is a multistep process. Here are the recommended tasks for planning for logical partitions. Â  Â  __ Compile a list of the questions that you must answer before you create logical partition on an existing system or place your order for new hardware. The following is the list of questions: What are your existing workloads? How many resources do these workloads currently require (during typical usage and at peak usage)? What are your future needs? How will your existing workloads grow over the life of your system? How many new workloads will you have to support over the life of your system?  Do you have an existing system onto which you can consolidate the workloads? Must you upgrade the existing system before you consolidate the workloads? Does it make more sense to purchase a new system for these workloads? What physical infrastructure will you have to support any new hardware? Can your current location accommodate the new hardware? Must you upgrade your power infrastructure or your cooling infrastructure? Will your new hardware work with your existing hardware? Which hardware features will you use? For example, do you want to use virtual I/O to consolidate I/O resources? Must you obtain activation codes or enablement codes to use these features? Must you obtain additional licenses to run your applications? If so, how many additional licenses do you need? Does the support strategy for you new hardware differ from the support strategy for your existing hardware? If so, what changes must you make to maximize the effectiveness of the new support strategy? Must you migrate your workloads onto new hardware? If so, what must you do to migrate these workloads? __ Your system has many features that allow you to use system resources more efficiently and simplify daily tasks. For more information about what these features are and how these features work, see . __ IBMÂ® provides many tools that you can use to assess your needs, determine the hardware that you need to accommodate existing and future needs, and compile an order for the hardware that you need.

Trusted Boot uses the Virtual Trusted Platform Module (VTPM) as described by the Trusted Computing Group. Up to 60 logical partitions per server can be configured to have their own unique VTPM by using the  (). The VTPM is used to record the system boot and, in association with the  Trusted Execution technology, provides security and assurance of the boot image on disk, on the entire operating system, and in the application layers.  With  () Version 2.2.1.4 or later, and  processor-based servers with firmware at level 7.4, or later, you can use the Trusted Firewall feature. Trusted Firewall is a feature of the PowerSC Editions. You can use the Trusted Firewall feature to provide a virtual firewall that allows network filtering and control within the local server. The virtual firewall improves performance and reduces the consumption of network resources by allowing direct and secure network traffic between logical partitions that are on different VLANs of the same server. Review the requirements for the system,  (VIOS), logical partitions, and paging space devices so that you can successfully configure shared memory.  When you suspend a logical partition, the operating system and applications running on the logical partition are also suspended, and its virtual server state is stored in persistent storage. At a later time, you can resume the operation of the logical partition. There are certain configurations requirements to make a logical partition capable of suspension.  Before planning to suspend a logical partition, verify that the server supports partitions that are capable of partition suspension by using the  (). Before planning to suspend a logical partition, verify that the logical partition can be suspended by using the  (). Before planning to enable a Virtual Trusted Platform Module (VTPM) on a logical partition, verify that the server supports VTPM by using the  (). If you are using the  () Version 7 Release 7.7.0, or later, you can use Virtual Station Interface (VSI) profiles with virtual Ethernet adapters in logical partitions and assign the Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) switching mode to virtual Ethernet switches.

SR-IOV is a Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group specification to allow multiple partitions that are running simultaneously within a single computer to share  a Peripheral Component Interconnect-Express (PCIe) device.  You can view the logical port limit and the owner of the single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) adapter by using the  (). Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to plan for the shared memory pool, the shared memory partitions, the paging space devices, and the  logical partitions (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions).  You need to consider the degree to which you want to overcommit the physical memory in the shared memory pool, the performance of the workloads when running in a shared memory configuration that is overcommitted, and the minimum and maximum boundaries of the shared memory pool. If you use  licensed programs on a server with logical partitions, consider how many software licenses are required for your logical partition configuration. Careful consideration of your software might help minimize the number of software licenses that you must purchase. Each logical partition requires at least a certain amount of hardware resources. You can assign hardware resources directly to a logical partition, or you can set the logical partition to use the hardware resources that are assigned to another logical partition. The minimum hardware configuration requirements for each logical partition depend on the operating system or software installed on the logical partition. Parent topic:          
 Logical partition overview Logical partitioning is the ability to make a server run as if it were two or more independent servers. When you logically partition a server, you divide the resources on the server into subsets called logical partitions. You can install software on a logical partition, and the logical partition runs as an independent logical server with the resources that you have allocated to the logical partition.  You can assign processors, memory, and input/output devices to logical partitions. You can run  and the  in logical partitions. The  provides virtual I/O resources to other logical partitions with general-purpose operating systems. Logical partitions share a few system attributes, such as the system serial number, system model, and processor feature code. All other system attributes can vary from one logical partition to another. You must use tools to create logical partitions on your servers. The tool that you use to create logical partitions on each server depends on the server model and the operating systems and features that you want to use on the server. When you create logical partitions on your server, you can consolidate servers, share system resources, create mixed environments, and run integrated clusters. Although each logical partition acts as an independent server, the logical partitions on a server can share some kinds of resources with each other. The ability to share resources among many logical partitions allows you to increase resource utilization on the server and to move the server resources to where they are needed.  A managed system is a single physical server plus the resources that are connected to the physical server. The physical server and the connected resources are managed by the physical server as a single unit. Connected resources can include expansion units, towers, and drawers, and storage area network (SAN) resources that are assigned to the server. The manufacturing default configuration is the initial single partition setup of the managed system as received from your service provider.  You must use tools to create logical partitions on your servers. The tool that you use to create logical partitions on each server depends upon the server model and the operating systems and features that you want to use on the server. When you create logical partitions on a managed system, you can assign the physical resources on the managed system directly to logical partitions. You can also share hardware resources among logical partitions by virtualizing those hardware resources. The methods used to virtualize and share hardware resources depend on the type of resource that you are sharing. Learn how to integrate  with  applications and data. You can use the logical partitioning examples to consolidate servers, use computing resources more efficiently, and increase the flexibility of your enterprise. Parent topic:          
 Benefits of logical partitioning When you create logical partitions on your server, you can consolidate servers, share system resources, create mixed environments, and run integrated clusters. The following scenarios illustrate the benefits of partitioning your server: Consolidating servers A logically partitioned server can reduce the number of servers that are needed within an enterprise. You can consolidate several servers into a single logically partitioned system. This eliminates the need for, and expense of, additional equipment. Sharing resources You can quickly and easily move hardware resources from one logical partition to another as needs change. Technologies such as the  technology, allow for processor resources to be shared automatically among logical partitions that use a shared processor pool.  Other technologies, such as dynamic partitioning, allow for resources to be manually moved to, from, and between running logical partitions without shutting down or restarting the logical partitions.   Maintaining independent servers Dedicating a portion of the resources (disk storage unit, processors, memory, and I/O devices) to a logical partition achieves logical isolation of software. If configured correctly, logical partitions also have some hardware fault tolerance.   Creating a mixed production and test environment You can create a combined production and test environment on the same server. The production logical partition can run your main business applications, and the test logical partition is used to test software. A failure in a test logical partition, while not necessarily planned, does not disrupt normal business operations.  Merging production and test environments Partitioning enables separate logical partitions to be allocated for production and test servers, eliminating the need to purchase additional hardware and software. When testing has been completed, the resources allocated to the test logical partition can be returned to the production logical partition or elsewhere as required. As new projects are developed, they can be built and tested on the same hardware on which they are eventually deployed.  Running integrated clusters Using high-availability application software, your partitioned server can run as an integrated cluster. You can use an integrated cluster to protect your server from most unscheduled failures within a logical partition. Although there are many benefits to creating logical partitions, consider the following points before choosing to use logical partitions: Processor and memory failures might result in the failure of the entire server with all of its logical partitions. (The failure of a single I/O device affects only the logical partition to which the I/O device belongs.) To reduce the possibility of system failure, you can use the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) to set the server to unconfigure failing processors or memory modules automatically. After the server unconfigures the failing processor or memory module, the server continues running without using the unconfigured processor or memory module. Administering a consolidated system might be more difficult in some ways than administering multiple smaller systems, particularly if the resources in the consolidated system are used at a level close to their capacity. If you anticipate that you will use your server at a level close to its capacity, consider ordering a server model that is capable of Capacity on Demand (CoD).

 Sharing resources between logical partitions Although each logical partition acts as an independent server, the logical partitions on a server can share some kinds of resources with each other. The ability to share resources among many logical partitions allows you to increase resource utilization on the server and to move the server resources to where they are needed.  The following list illustrates some of the ways in which logical partitions can share resources. For some server models, the features mentioned in this list are options for which you must obtain and enter an activation code: The  technology (or shared processing) allows logical partitions to share the processors in shared processor pools. Each logical partition that uses shared processors is assigned a specific amount of processor power from its shared processor pool. By default, each logical partition is set so that the logical partition uses no more than its assigned processor power. Optionally, you can set a logical partition so that the logical partition can use processor power that is not being used by other logical partitions in its shared processor pool. If you set the logical partition so that it can use unused processor power, the amount of processor power that the logical partition can use is limited by the virtual processor settings of the logical partition and by the amount of unused processor power available in the shared processor pool that is used by the logical partition. The Dynamic partitioning feature allows you to manually move resources to, from, and between running logical partitions without shutting down or restarting the logical partitions. This allows you to share devices that logical partitions use occasionally. For example, if the logical partitions on your server use an optical drive occasionally, you can assign a single optical drive to multiple logical partitions as a desired device. The optical drive would belong to only one logical partition at a time, but you can use dynamic partitioning to move the optical drive between logical partitions as needed.  Virtual I/O allows logical partitions to access and use I/O resources on other logical partitions. For example, virtual Ethernet allows you to create a virtual LAN that connects the logical partitions on your server to each other. If one of the logical partitions on the server has a physical Ethernet adapter that is connected to an external network, you can configure the operating system of that logical partition to connect the virtual LAN with the physical Ethernet adapter. This allows the logical partitions on the server to share a physical Ethernet connection to an external network. A  (HEA), or Integrated Virtual Ethernet (IVE), allows multiple logical partitions on the same  to share a single physical Ethernet adapter. Unlike most other types of I/O devices, you can never assign the HEA itself to a logical partition. Instead, multiple logical partitions can connect directly to the HEA and use the HEA resources. This allows these logical partitions to access external networks through the HEA without having to go through an Ethernet bridge on another logical partition. The single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) specification defines extensions to the PCI ExpressÂ® (PCIe) specification. SR-IOV allows virtualization of the physical ports of an adapter so that the ports can be shared by multiple partitions that are running simultaneously. For example, a single physical Ethernet port appears as several separate physical devices. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Shared processors Shared processors are physical processors whose processing capacity is shared among multiple logical partitions. The ability to divide physical processors and share them among multiple logical partitions is known as the  technology.  For some models, the  technology is an option for which you must obtain and enter a  activation code.  By default, all physical processors that are not dedicated to specific logical partitions are grouped together in a shared processor pool. You can assign a specific amount of the processing capacity in this shared processor pool to each logical partition that uses shared processors. Some models allow you to use the  to configure multiple shared processor pools. These models have a default shared processor pool that contains all the processors that do not belong to logical partitions that use dedicated processors or logical partitions that use other shared processor pools. The other shared processor pools on these models can be configured with a maximum processing unit value and a reserved processing unit  value. The maximum processing unit  value limits the total number of processing unit  that can be used by the logical partitions in the shared processor pool. The reserved processing unit  value is the number of processing units that are reserved for the use of uncapped logical partitions within the shared processor pool. You can assign partial processors to a logical partition that uses shared processors. Processing units are a unit of measure for shared processing power across one or more virtual processors. One shared processing unit on one virtual processor accomplishes approximately the same work as one dedicated processor.  The minimum number of processing units depends on the firmware level.Firmware level Minimum number of processing units per virtual processor Version 7.4, or earlier 0.10 Version 7.6, or later 0.05 Some server models allow logical partitions to use only a portion of the total active processors on the managed system, so you are not always able to assign the full processing capacity of the managed system to logical partitions. This is particularly true for server models with one or two processors, where a large portion of processor resources is used as overhead.  When the firmware is at level 7.6, or later, overall server performance can be impacted when there are too many virtual processors configured on the managed system. You can verify the number of configured virtual processors by using the  command from the  command line. The result of the  command might look like the following output:lshwres -m sysname -r proc --level sys -F curr_sys_virtual_procs,max_recommended_sys_virtual_procs 4,240 where:curr_sys_virtual_procs indicates the current number of configured virtual processors.  max_recommended_sys_virtual_procs indicates the recommended maximum number of configured virtual processors. It is suggested that the number of configured virtual processors not exceed the maximum number so that server performance is not affected.  On -managed systems, shared processors are assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. Logical partitions that use shared processors can have a sharing mode of capped or uncapped.  An uncapped logical partition is a logical partition that can use more processor power than its assigned processing capacity. The amount of processing capacity that an uncapped logical partition can use is limited only by the number of virtual processors assigned to the logical partition or the maximum processing unit  allowed by the shared processor pool that the logical partition uses. In contrast, a capped logical partition is a logical partition that cannot use more processor power than its assigned processing units.  For example, logical partitions 2 and 3 are uncapped logical partitions, and logical partition 4 is a capped logical partition. Logical partitions 2 and 3 are each assigned 3.00 processing units and four virtual processors. Logical partition 2 currently uses only 1.00 of its 3.00 processing units, but logical partition 3 currently has a workload demand that requires 4.00 processing units. Because logical partition 3 is uncapped and has four virtual processors, the server firmware automatically allows logical partition 3 to use 1.00 processing units from logical partition 2. This increases the processing power for logical partition 3 to 4.00 processing units. Soon afterwards, logical partition 2 increases its workload demand to 3.00 processing units. The server firmware therefore automatically returns 1.00 processing units to logical partition 2 so that logical partition 2 can use its full, assigned processing capacity once more. Logical partition 4 is assigned 2.00 processing units and three virtual processors, but currently has a workload demand that requires 3.00 processing units. Because logical partition 4 is capped, logical partition 4 cannot use any unused processing units from logical partitions 2 or 3. However, if the workload demand of logical partition 4 decreases below 2.00 processing units, logical partitions 2 and 3 could use any unused processing units from logical partition 4. By default, logical partitions that use shared processors are capped logical partitions. You can set a logical partition to be an uncapped logical partition if you want the logical partition to use more processing power than its assigned amount.  Although an uncapped logical partition can use more processor power than its assigned processing capacity, the uncapped logical partition can never use more processing units than its assigned number of virtual processors. Also, the logical partitions that use a shared processor pool can never use more processing units than the maximum processing units configured for the shared processor pool. If multiple uncapped logical partitions need additional processor capacity at the same time, the server can distribute the unused processing capacity to all uncapped logical partitions.  This distribution process is determined by the uncapped weight of each of the logical partitions.    Uncapped weight is a number in the range of 0 through 255 that you set for each uncapped logical partition in the shared processor pool. On the , you can choose from any of the 256 possible uncapped weight values.   By setting the uncapped weight (255 being the highest weight), any available unused capacity is distributed to contending logical partitions in proportion to the established value of the uncapped weight.  The default uncapped weight value is 128. When you set the uncapped weight to 0, no unused capacity is distributed to the logical partition. Uncapped weight is only used where there are more virtual processors ready to consume unused resources than there are physical processors in the shared processor pool. If no contention exists for processor resources, the virtual processors are immediately distributed across the logical partitions independent of their uncapped weights. This can result in situations where the uncapped weights of the logical partitions do not exactly reflect the amount of unused capacity.  For example, logical partition 2 has one virtual processor and an uncapped weight of 100. Logical partition 3 also has one virtual processor, but an uncapped weight of 200. If logical partitions 2 and 3 both require additional processing capacity, and there is not enough physical processor capacity to run both logical partitions, logical partition 3 receives two additional processing units for every additional processing unit that logical partition 2 receives. If logical partitions 2 and 3 both require additional processing capacity, and there is enough physical processor capacity to run both logical partitions, logical partition 2 and 3 receive an equal amount of unused capacity. In this situation, their uncapped weights are ignored. The server distributes unused capacity among all of the uncapped shared processor partitions that are configured on the server, regardless of the shared processor pools to which they are assigned.  For example, you configure logical partition 1 to the default shared processor pool. You configure logical partition 2 and logical partition 3 to a different shared processor pool. All three logical partitions compete for the same unused physical processor capacity in the server, even though they belong to different shared processor pools.

 Processors A processor is a device that processes programmed instructions. The more processors that you assign to a logical partition, the greater the number of concurrent operations that the logical partition can run at any given time. You can set a logical partition to use either processors that are dedicated to the logical partition or processors that are shared with other logical partitions. If a logical partition uses dedicated processors, then you must assign processors (in increments of whole numbers) to the logical partition. A logical partition that uses dedicated processors cannot use any processing capacity beyond the processors that are assigned to the logical partition.  By default, all physical processors that are not dedicated to specific logical partitions are grouped together in a shared processor pool. You can assign a specific amount of the processing capacity in this shared processor pool to each logical partition that uses shared processors. Some models allow you to use the  to configure multiple shared processor pools. These models have a default shared processor pool that contains all the processor resources that do not belong to logical partitions that use dedicated processors or logical partitions that use other shared processor pools. The other shared processor pools on these models can be configured with a maximum processing unit value and a reserved processing unit value. The maximum processing unit value limits the total number of processors that can be used by the logical partitions in the shared processor pool. The reserved processing unit value is the number of processing units that are reserved for the use of uncapped logical partitions within the shared processor pool. You can set a logical partition that uses shared processors to use as little as 0.10 processing units, which is approximately a 10th of the processing capacity of a single processor.  You can specify the number of processing units to be used by a shared processor logical partition down to the 100th of a processing unit. Also, you can set a shared processor logical partition so that, if the logical partition requires more processing capacity than its assigned number of processing units, the logical partition can use processor resources that are not assigned to any logical partition or processor resources that are assigned to another logical partition but that are not being used by the other logical partition. (Some server models might require you to enter an activation code before you can create logical partitions that use shared processors.) You can assign up to the entire processing capacity on the managed system to a single logical partition, if the operating system and server model supports doing so. You can configure your managed system so that it does not comply with the software license agreement for your managed system, but you will receive out-of-compliance messages if you operate the managed system in such a configuration.  Automatic redistribution of work when a processor failsIf the server firmware detects that a processor is about to fail, or if a processor fails when the processor is not in use, then the server firmware creates a serviceable event. The server firmware can also unconfigure the failing processor automatically, depending upon the type of failure and the unconfiguration policies that you set up using the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI). You can also unconfigure a failing processor manually using the ASMI. When the server firmware unconfigures a failing processor, and there are no unassigned or unlicensed processors available on the managed system, the processor unconfiguration can cause the logical partition to which the processor is assigned to shut down. A logical partition can take processors only from logical partitions with lower partition-availability priorities. If all of the logical partitions on your managed system have the same partition-availability priority, then a logical partition can replace a failed processor only if the managed system has unlicensed or unassigned processors.   By default, the partition-availability priority of  logical partitions with virtual SCSI adapters is set to 191. The partition availablity priority of all other logical partitions is set to 127 by default.    Do not set the priority of  logical partitions to be lower than the priority of the logical partitions that use the resources on the  logical partition.    If the managed system shuts down a logical partition because of its partition availability priority, all logical partitions that use the resources on that logical partition are also shut down.  If a processor fails when the processor is in use, then the entire managed system shuts down. When a processor failure causes the entire managed system to shut down, the system unconfigures the processor and restarts. The managed system attempts to start the logical partitions that were running at the time of the processor failure with their minimum processor values, in partition-availability priority order, with the logical partition with the highest partition-availability priority being started first. If the managed system does not have enough processor resources to start all of the logical partitions with their minimum processor values, then the managed system starts as many logical partitions as it can with their minimum processor values. If there are any processor resources remaining after the managed system has started the logical partitions, then the managed system distributes any remaining processor resources to the running logical partitions in proportion to their desired processor values.  Dedicated processors are whole processors that are assigned to a single logical partition.  Shared processors are physical processors whose processing capacity is shared among multiple logical partitions. The ability to divide physical processors and share them among multiple logical partitions is known as the  technology. A virtual processor is a representation of a physical processor core to the operating system of a logical partition that uses shared processors.  The minimum number of processing units of a logical partition depends on the firmware level and the version of the operating system that is running on the logical partition.

 Dedicated processors Dedicated processors are whole processors that are assigned to a single logical partition.  If you choose to assign dedicated processors to a logical partition, you must assign at least one processor to that logical partition. Likewise, if you choose to remove processor resources from a dedicated logical partition, you must remove at least one processor from the logical partition. On systems that are managed by a  (), dedicated processors are assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. By default, a powered-off logical partition using dedicated processors has its processors available to uncapped logical partitions that use shared processors.  If the uncapped logical partition needs additional processor resources, the uncapped logical partition can use the idle processors that belong to the powered-off dedicated logical partition, if the total number of processors used by the uncapped logical partition does not exceed the virtual processors assigned to the uncapped logical partition, and if the use of these idle processors does not cause the shared processor pool to exceed its maximum processing units. When you power on the dedicated logical partition while the uncapped logical partition is using the processors, the activated logical partition regains all of its processing resources. If you use the , you can prevent dedicated processors from being used in the shared processor pool by disabling this function in the partition properties panels. You can also set the properties of a logical partition using dedicated processors so that unused processing cycles on those dedicated processors can be made available to uncapped logical partitions while the dedicated processor logical partition is running. You can change the processor sharing mode of the dedicated processor logical partition at any time, without having to shut down and restart the logical partition.

 Partition profile A partition profile is a record on the  () that specifies a possible configuration for a logical partition. When you activate a logical partition using a partition profile, the managed system attempts to start the logical partition using the configuration information in the partition profile.  A partition profile specifies the desired system resources for the logical partition and the minimum and maximum amounts of system resources that the logical partition can have. The system resources specified within a partition profile includes processors, memory, and I/O resources. The partition profile can also specify certain operating settings for the logical partition. For example, you can set a partition profile so that, when the partition profile is activated, the logical partition is set to start automatically the next time that you power on the managed system. Each logical partition on a managed system that is managed by an  has at least one partition profile. If desired, you can create additional partition profiles with different resource specifications for your logical partition. If you create multiple partition profiles, you can designate any partition profile on the logical partition to be the default partition profile. The  activates the default profile if you do not select a specific partition profile to be activated. Only one partition profile can be active at one time. To activate another partition profile for a logical partition, you must shut down the logical partition before you activate the other partition profile.  A partition profile is identified by the logical partition ID and partition profile name. Logical partition IDs are whole numbers used to identify each logical partition that you create on a managed system, and partition profile names identify the partition profiles that you create for each logical partition. Each partition profile on a logical partition must have a unique partition profile name, but you can use a partition profile name for different logical partitions on a single managed system. For example, logical partition 1 cannot have more than one partition profile with a partition profile name of normal, but you can create a normal partition profile for each logical partition on the managed system. When you create a partition profile, the  shows you all of the resources available on your system.  The  does not verify if another partition profile is currently using a portion of these resources.  Therefore, it is possible for you to over commit resources. When you activate a logical partition using a partition profile, the system attempts to start the logical partition using the resources that are specified in the partition profile. If the minimum resources specified in the partition profile are not available on the managed system, the logical partition cannot be started using the partition profile.   For example, you have four processors on your managed system.  Logical partition 1 with partition profile A has three processors, and logical partition 2 with partition profile B has two processors.  If you attempt to activate both of these partition profiles at the same time, logical partition 2 with partition profile B fails to activate because you have over committed processor resources. When you shut down a logical partition and reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile, the partition profile overlays the resource specifications of the logical partition with the resource specifications in the partition profile. Any resource changes that you made to the logical partition using dynamic partitioning are lost when you reactivate the logical partition using a partition profile. This is desirable when you want to undo dynamic partitioning changes to the logical partition. However, this is not desirable if you want to reactivate the logical partition using the resource specifications that the logical partition had when you shut down the managed system. It is therefore best to keep your partition profiles up to date with the latest resource specifications. You can save the current configuration of the logical partition as a partition profile. This allows you to avoid having to change partition profiles manually. If you shut down a logical partition whose partition profiles are not up to date, and the logical partition is set to start automatically when the managed system starts, you can preserve the resource specifications on that logical partition by restarting the entire managed system using the partition autostart power-on mode. When the logical partitions start automatically, the logical partitions have the resource specifications that the logical partitions had when you shut down the managed system. You must activate a logical partition by activating a partition profile at least once. After that, you can activate the logical partition based on its current configuration data that is saved in the hypervisor. Logical partitions start faster when activated based on their current configuration data than when activated with a partition profile. When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of processor resources that you want for the logical partition.  When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory resources that you want for the logical partition.  I/O devices are assigned to partition profiles on a slot-by-slot basis. Most I/O devices can be assigned to a partition profile on the  as required or as desired. You can create partition profiles on your  that specify all of the resources on the managed system. If you activate a logical partition using such a partition profile, then the managed system assigns all of its resources to the logical partition. Parent topic:  Related tasks:         
 Processor resource assignment in partition profiles When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of processor resources that you want for the logical partition.  The desired value is the resource amount that the logical partition gets if you do not over commit the resource on the managed system. If the desired amount of resources is available when you activate the partition profile, then the logical partition starts with the desired amount of resources. However, if the desired amount of resources is not available when you activate the partition profile, then the resources on your managed system are over committed. If the amount of resources that are available on the managed system is equal to or greater than the minimum amount of resources in the partition profile, then the logical partition starts with the available amount of resources. If the minimum amount of resources is not met, then the logical partition does not start. If the managed system allows the configuration of multiple shared processor pools, then you can limit the number of processors that are used by a specific group of logical partitions by configuring a shared processor pool for those logical partitions and reassigning those logical partitions to that shared processor pool.  If you create a partition profile that is set to use shared processors, the  calculates a minimum, maximum, and desired number of virtual processors for the partition profile. The calculation of virtual processors is based upon the minimum, maximum, and desired number of processing units that you specify for the partition profile. By default, the virtual processor settings are calculated as follows:The default minimum number of virtual processors is the minimum number of processing units (rounded up to the next whole number). For example, if the minimum number of processing units is 0.8, the default minimum number of virtual processors is 1.  The default desired number of virtual processors is the desired number of processing units (rounded up to the next whole number). For example, if the desired number of processing units is 2.8, the default desired number of virtual processors is 3.  The default maximum number of virtual processors is the maximum number of processing units rounded up to the next whole number and multiplied by two. For example, if the maximum number of processing units is 3.2, the default maximum number of virtual processors is 8 (four times 2).  When you activate the logical partition using the partition profile on the , the logical partition is assigned the desired number of virtual processors. You can then use dynamic partitioning to change the number of virtual processors to any number between the minimum and maximum values, so long as the number of virtual processors is greater than the number of processing units that are assigned to the logical partition. Before changing the default settings, performance modeling should be performed. For example, you create a partition profile on the  with the following processor unit settings. Minimum processing units 1.25  Desired processing units 3.80  Maximum processing units 5.00  The default virtual processor settings for this partition profile on the  are as follows. Minimum virtual processors 2  Desired virtual processors 4  Maximum virtual processors 10  When you activate the logical partition using this partition profile on the , the operating system sees four processors, because the logical partition is activated with the desired value of four virtual processors. Each of these virtual processors has 0.95 processing units supporting the work assigned to the processor. After the logical partition is activated, you can use dynamic partitioning to change the number of virtual processors on the logical partition to any between number 2 - 10, so long as the number of virtual processors is greater than the number of processing units that are assigned to the logical partition. If you increase the number of virtual processors, bear in mind that you will less processing power supporting the work assigned to each processor. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Memory resource assignment in partition profiles When you create a partition profile for a logical partition, you set up the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory resources that you want for the logical partition.  When you create a partition profile , the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory that you specify refer to physical memory in the system. If the desired amount of physical memory is available on the managed system when you activate the partition profile, the logical partition starts with the desired amount of physical memory. However, if the desired amount of physical memory is not available when you activate the partition profile, the physical memory on your managed system is over committed. In that case, if the amount of physical memory that is available on the managed system is equal to or greater than the minimum amount of physical memory in the partition profile, the logical partition starts with the available amount of physical memory. If the minimum amount of physical memory is not available, then the logical partition does not start. When you create a partition profile that is set to use shared memory, the desired, minimum, and maximum amounts of memory that you specify refer to logical memory. When you activate the partition profile, the logical partition starts with the desired amount of logical memory. You can dynamically add and remove logical memory to and from a running logical partition within the minimum and maximum values set in the partition profile. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Memory Processors use memory to temporarily hold information. Memory requirements for logical partitions depend on the logical partition configuration, I/O resources assigned, and applications used. Memory can be assigned in increments of 16 MB, 32 MB, 64 MB, 128 MB, and 256 MB. The default memory block size varies according to the amount of configurable memory in the system.   Amount of configurable memory Default memory block size Less than 4 GB 16 MB Greater than 4 GB up to 8 GB 32 MB Greater than 8 GB up to 16 GB 64 MB Greater than 16 GB up to 32 GB 128 MB Greater than 32 GB 256 MB There are limits on how large a logical partition can grow based on the amount of memory initially allocated to it. Memory is added and removed to and from logical partitions in units of logical memory blocks. For logical partitions that are initially sized less than 256 MB, the maximum size to which a logical partition can grow is 16 times its initial size (up to the assigned maximum memory of the logical partition). For logical partitions that are initially sized 256 MB or larger, the maximum size to which the logical partition can grow is 64 times its initial size (up to the assigned maximum memory of the logical partition). The smallest increment for adding or removing memory to or from a logical partition is 16 MB. The memory block size can be changed by using the , or the Logical Memory Block Size option in the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI). The machine default value should only be changed under direction from your service provider. To change the memory block size, you must be a user with administrator authority, and you must shut down and restart the managed system for the change to take effect. If the minimum memory amount in any partition profile on the managed system is less than the new memory block size, you must also change the minimum memory amount in the partition profile. Each logical partition has a hardware page table (HPT).  The HPT ratio is the ratio of the HPT size to the maximum memory value for the logical partition. The HPT is allocated in the server firmware memory overhead for the logical partition, and the size of the HPT can affect the performance of the logical partition. The size of the HPT is determined by the following factors: The HPT ratio of 1/64 is the default value for all logical partitions. You can override the default value by using the  command-line interface to change the value in the partition profile. The maximum memory values that you establish for the logical partition  On systems that are managed by a , memory is assigned to logical partitions using partition profiles. On systems that are managed by the , memory is assigned to logical partitions using the partition properties.  memory is physical system memory that you assign to a logical partition , and is reserved for use by the partition until you remove the memory from the partition or delete the partition. You can configure your system so that multiple logical partitions share a pool of physical memory. A shared memory environment includes the shared memory pool, logical partitions that use the shared memory in the shared memory pool, logical memory, I/O entitled memory, at least one  logical partition, and paging space devices. When you enable  for an  logical partition, you increase the memory capacity of the logical partition without assigning more memory to it. The operating system compresses a portion of the memory that the logical partition uses. This compression creates space for more data and expanding the memory capacity of the logical partition.

  memory  memory is physical system memory that you assign to a logical partition , and is reserved for use by the partition until you remove the memory from the partition or delete the partition. Depending on the overall memory in your system and the maximum memory values you choose for each logical partition, the server firmware must have enough memory to perform logical partition tasks. The amount of memory required by the server firmware varies according to several factors.  The following factors influence server firmware memory requirements: Number of partitions Partition environments of the partitions Number of physical and virtual I/O devices used by the partitions Maximum memory values given to the partitions  Firmware level updates can also change the server firmware memory requirements. Larger memory block sizes can exaggerate the memory requirement change. When selecting the maximum memory values for each  partition, consider the following points: Maximum values affect the hardware page table (HPT) size for each partition The logical memory map size for each partition If the server firmware detects that a memory module has failed or is about to fail, the server firmware creates a serviceable event. The server firmware can also unconfigure the failing memory module automatically, depending on the type of failure and the deconfiguration policies that you set up using the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI). You can also unconfigure a failing memory module manually using the ASMI. If a memory module failure causes the entire managed system to shut down, the managed system restarts automatically if the managed system is in normal IPL mode. When the managed system restarts itself, or when you restart the managed system manually, the managed system attempts to start the partitions that were running at the time of the memory module failure with their minimum memory values. If the managed system does not have enough memory to start all of the partitions with their minimum memory values, the managed system starts as many partitions as it can with their minimum memory values. If any memory is left over after the managed system has started as many partitions as it can, the managed system distributes the remaining memory resources to the running partitions in proportion to their wanted memory values.

 Setting huge-page memory values for  partitions Specify the number of 16 GB pages to allocate to an  huge-page memory pool. On managed systems that support huge-page memory, you can use the  () to set the value for the huge-page memory pool. You can also specify values for the number of huge pages to allocate to logical partitions. Using huge pages can improve performance in specific environments that require a high degree of parallelism, such as in DB2Â® database. You can specify huge-page memory that can be used for the shared-memory buffer pools in DB2. For logically partitioned systems, you can specify the minimum, wanted, and maximum number of huge pages to assign to a logical partition when you create the logical partition or partition profile.  To set the huge-page memory values, the system must be in the powered-off state. The new value takes effect when you restart the system.

 Calculating huge-page memory requirements for  partitions Calculate the value for the number of pages to allocate to an  huge-page memory pool. To use huge-page memory, you must ensure that your system has adequate memory resources to dedicate to the huge-page memory pool. The huge-page memory pool is a region of system memory that is mapped as 16 GB page segments and is managed separately from the base memory of the system. Before you can specify the value for huge-page memory, you must determine which applications you are running and what the huge-page requirements are for your applications. Determining huge-page memory requirements for your application The huge-page memory pool can be used to enhance performance for DB2Â® in  operating systems. To determine this value, calculate the amount of memory required for the shared buffer pool to support your DB2 applications. Refer to the DB2 recommendations for buffer pool memory for your particular application.  The huge page memory allocation cannot be changed dynamically. When you change the number of huge pages on the server requires that you reboot the server. Changing the number of assigned huge pages for a logical partition requires that you restart the logical partition. Considerations for calculating the huge-page values The amount of huge-page memory that you can allocate is dependent on the following factors:Total amount of licensed memory for your server Amount of available memory after configured memory resources are accounted for Number of physical IO connections to the server (each IO connection requires memory for the IO tables, which can be distributed among the physical memory regions and reduces the memory available for huge pages) Base memory configuration for logical partitions (huge pages are not calculated as part of the configured-partition memory allocation) The requirements that define a huge page, that is each huge page requires 16 GB of contiguous real memory and must start on a 16 GB memory boundary Huge pages cannot span processing units. Each processing unit requires 32 GB to ensure at least one 16 GB huge page when all of the other considerations previously listed are taken into account.  The server firmware reduces the huge-page pool size to satisfy some of these dependencies.  When this occurs, error log entries are generated to indicate that the huge-page pool size was reduced.  The error log reference code is B700 5300.  The reference code details  indicates hexadecimal values that indicate why the huge-page pool size could not be satisfied.  The following example shows the possible entries and how to interpret the additional words in these entries:word 3 = 0x0000000100000106: This means that the huge-page pool was reduced to satisfy the system hardware configuration word 4 = number of user-configured huge pages word 5 = number of huge pages that could be provided word 3 = 0x0000000100000105: This means that the huge-page pool was reduced to satisfy the memory configuration of logical partitionsword 4 = number of huge pages before logical partitions were created word 5 = firmware calculated number of huge pages after satisfying logical partition memory requirements word 6 = number of huge pages in the pool Calculating huge-page memory values To calculate the server memory requirements to support huge pages, use the following steps: Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Viewing and setting huge-page memory values for  partitions View and set values for  huge-page memory allocation. On systems that support huge-page (16 GB) memory allocation, you can set the current value in the huge-page memory table. On a new system, you must set this value initially to establish the huge-page memory pool. You must set the value when the managed system is in the powered-off state. If this value is already set, you must change the value to adjust for performance needs based on the applications that you are running and your logical partition configurations. You can also change the values set for the number of huge pages allocated to your logical partitions.  Use this task to set or adjust the number of 16 GB pages for the huge-page allocation according to your needs.  To change the values for logical partitions, you must shut down the logical partition. The new value takes effect when you restart the logical partition. To set huge-page memory values for a logical partition, do the following: Parent topic:  Related information:         
 Shared memory You can configure your system so that multiple logical partitions share a pool of physical memory. A shared memory environment includes the shared memory pool, logical partitions that use the shared memory in the shared memory pool, logical memory, I/O entitled memory, at least one  logical partition, and paging space devices. Shared memory is physical memory that is assigned to the shared memory pool and shared among multiple logical partitions. The shared memory pool is a defined collection of physical memory blocks that are managed as a single memory pool by the hypervisor. Logical partitions that you configure to use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) share the memory in the pool with other shared memory partitions. When the operating system that runs in a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) needs to access data, the data must reside in the shared memory pool. Systems with overcommitted memory configurations require the hypervisor and at least one  (VIOS) logical partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partition) to move data between the shared memory pool and the paging space devices as needed. Logical memory is the address space, assigned to a logical partition, that the operating system perceives as its main storage. For a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition), a subset of the logical memory is backed up by physical main storage and the remaining logical memory is kept in auxiliary storage. I/O entitled memory is the maximum amount of physical memory (from the shared memory pool) that is guaranteed to be available to a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) for its I/O devices at any given time. A  (VIOS) logical partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) provides access to the paging space devices for the logical partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions). You can learn about how the  () and  allocate and manipulate paging space devices on systems that use shared memory. The hypervisor uses the memory weight of each logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) to help determine which logical partitions receive more physical memory from the shared memory pool. To help optimize performance and memory use, the operating systems that run in shared memory partitions provide the hypervisor with information about how the operating system uses its memory to help the hypervisor determine which pages to store in the shared memory pool and which pages to store in the paging space devices.

 Overview of shared memory Shared memory is physical memory that is assigned to the shared memory pool and shared among multiple logical partitions. The shared memory pool is a defined collection of physical memory blocks that are managed as a single memory pool by the hypervisor. Logical partitions that you configure to use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) share the memory in the pool with other shared memory partitions.  For example, you create a shared memory pool with 16 GB of physical memory. You then create three logical partitions, configure them to use shared memory, and activate the shared memory partitions. Each shared memory partition can use the 16 GB that are in the shared memory pool.  The hypervisor determines the amount of memory allocated from the shared memory pool to each shared memory partition based on the workload and memory configuration of each shared memory partition. When allocating the physical memory to the shared memory partitions, the hypervisor ensures that each shared memory partition can access only the memory allocated to the shared memory partition at any given time. A shared memory partition cannot access the physical memory allocated to another shared memory partition. The amount of memory that you assign to the shared memory partitions can be greater than the amount of memory in the shared memory pool. For example, you can assign 12 GB to shared memory partition 1, 8 GB to shared memory partition 2, and 4 GB to shared memory partition 3. Together, the shared memory partitions use 24 GB of memory, but the shared memory pool has only 16 GB of memory. In this situation, the memory configuration is considered overcommitted. Overcommitted memory configurations are possible because the hypervisor virtualizes and manages all of the memory for the shared memory partitions in the shared memory pool as follows: When shared memory partitions are not actively using their memory pages, the hypervisor allocates those unused memory pages to shared memory partitions that currently need them.  The hypervisor does not need to store any data in auxiliary storage. When a shared memory partition requires more memory than the hypervisor can provide to it by allocating unused portions of the shared memory pool, the hypervisor stores some of the memory that belongs to a shared memory partition in the shared memory pool and stores the remainder of the memory that belongs to the shared memory partition in auxiliary storage.  When the operating system attempts to access the data, the hypervisor might need to retrieve the data from auxiliary storage before the operating system can access it.  Because the memory that you assign to a shared memory partition might not always reside in the shared memory pool, the memory that you assign to a shared memory partition is logical memory. Logical memory is the address space, assigned to a logical partition, that the operating system perceives as its main storage. For a shared memory partition, a subset of the logical memory is backed up by physical main storage (or physical memory from the shared memory pool) and the remaining logical memory is kept in auxiliary storage. A  logical partition provides access to the auxiliary storage, or paging space devices, required for shared memory partitions in an overcommitted memory configuration. A paging space device is a physical or logical device that is used by a  to provide the paging space for a shared memory partition. The paging space is an area of nonvolatile storage used to hold portions of a shared memory partition's logical memory that do not reside in the shared memory pool. When the operating system that runs in a shared memory partition attempts to access data, and the data is located in the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition, the hypervisor sends a request to a  to retrieve the data and write it to the shared memory pool so that the operating system can access it.  On systems that are managed by a  (), you can assign up to two  (VIOS) logical partitions to the shared memory pool at a time (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions). When you assign two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool, you can configure the paging space devices such that both paging VIOS partitions have access to the same paging space devices. When one paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable, the hypervisor sends a request to the other paging VIOS partition to retrieve the data on the paging space device.  You cannot configure paging VIOS partitions to use shared memory. Paging VIOS partitions do not use the memory in the shared memory pool. You assign paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool so that they can provide access to the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool. Driven by workload demands from the shared memory partitions, the hypervisor manages overcommitted memory configurations by continually performing the following tasks: Allocating portions of physical memory from the shared memory pool to the shared memory partitions as needed Requesting a paging VIOS partition to read and write data between the shared memory pool and the paging space devices as needed The ability to share memory among multiple logical partitions is known as the  technology. The  technology is available with the  for which you must obtain and enter a  activation code.  Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks: Related information:         
 Example: A shared memory configuration that is logically overcommitted The following figure shows a server with shared memory configuration that is logically overcommitted. The figure shows a shared memory pool of 16.25 GB that is shared among three shared memory partitions. The hypervisor uses a small portion (0.25 GB) of the shared memory pool to manage the shared memory resources. The figure also shows one paging VIOS partition that owns all of the physical storage in the system. The physical storage contains a paging space device for each shared memory partition. The paging VIOS partition does not use the memory in the shared memory pool, but rather receives dedicated memory of 1 GB. Of the remaining system memory, 1 GB is reserved for the hypervisor so that it can manage other system resources, and 13.75 GB is free memory that is available for system growth. For example, you can dynamically add more memory to the shared memory pool or you can create additional dedicated memory partitions. Shared memory partition 1 is assigned 12 GB of logical memory, Shared memory partition 2 is assigned 8 GB of logical memory, and Shared memory partition 3 is assigned 4 GB of logical memory. Together, the shared memory partitions are assigned 24 GB of logical memory, which is more than the 16.25 GB allocated to the shared memory pool. Therefore, the memory configuration is overcommitted. Shared memory partition 1 currently uses 8 GB of physical memory, Shared memory partition 2 currently uses 4 GB of physical memory, and Shared memory partition 3 currently uses 4 GB of physical memory. Together, the shared memory partitions currently use 16 GB of physical memory, which is equal to the amount of physical memory available to them in the shared memory pool. Therefore, the memory configuration is logically overcommitted. In other words, the shared memory pool contains enough physical memory for the hypervisor to allocate unused memory pages to shared memory partitions that need them. All of the memory currently used by the shared memory partitions resides in the shared memory pool. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Performance considerations for overcommitted shared memory partitions Learn about how the degree to which the memory configuration of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) is overcommitted affects the performance of the shared memory partition. In general, the less overcommitted the memory configuration of a shared memory partition, the better its performance. A shared memory configuration is considered overcommitted when the sum of the logical memory that is assigned to all of the shared memory partitions is greater than the amount of physical memory in the shared memory pool.      The figure shows a shared memory partition that is currently allocated 0.8 GB of physical memory and assigned 2.5 GB of logical memory. If the workload that runs in the shared memory partition currently uses 0.8 GB of memory and requires an additional 1.5 GB of memory, and the shared memory pool is physically overcommitted, the hypervisor stores 1.5 GB of the shared memory partition's memory in its paging space device. When the shared memory partition needs to access data on the paging space device, the hypervisor directs a paging VIOS partition to read the data from the paging space device and write the data to the shared memory pool. The more memory that the hypervisor must store on the paging space device, the more often the hypervisor and paging VIOS partition need to read and write data between the paging space device and the shared memory pool. Compared to directly accessing data that is stored in the shared memory pool, it takes more time to access data that is stored in the paging space device. Thus, in general, the less overcommitted the memory configuration of a shared memory partition, the better its performance. The operating systems that run in the shared memory partitions help improve the performance of the shared memory partitions with overcommitted memory configurations by providing the hypervisor with information about how the operating system uses the physical memory allocated to it. Using this information, the hypervisor can store data that the operating system accesses the least often in the paging space device and store the data that the operating system accesses the most often in the shared memory pool. This reduces the frequency that the hypervisor needs to access the paging space device and increases the performance of the shared memory partition.

 Performance considerations for shared memory partitions You can learn about performance factors (such as shared memory overcommitment) that influence the performance of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition). You can also use shared memory statistics to help you determine how to adjust the configuration of a shared memory partition to improve its performance. Learn about how the degree to which the memory configuration of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition) is overcommitted affects the performance of the shared memory partition. In general, the less overcommitted the memory configuration of a shared memory partition, the better its performance. In addition to overcommitment considerations, you need to consider other factors that can affect the performance of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition). These factors include the workload running in the shared memory partition, the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition, whether the operating system or applications that run in the shared memory partition use memory affinity. The  (), , and  environments provide statistics about the shared memory configuration. Parent topic:          
 Factors that influence the performance of shared memory partitions In addition to overcommitment considerations, you need to consider other factors that can affect the performance of a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition). These factors include the workload running in the shared memory partition, the I/O entitled memory of the shared memory partition, whether the operating system or applications that run in the shared memory partition use memory affinity. The following table describes the types of workloads that are appropriate to run in shared memory configurations that are logically and physically overcommitted. It also describes the types of workloads that are not appropriate to run in a shared memory configuration. Workloads for logically overcommitted configurations Workloads for physically overcommitted configurations Workloads for dedicated memory configurations Workloads that peak at opposite and varying times. Workloads with memory residency requirements that have a low average. Workloads that do not have a sustained load. Logical partitions that serve as failover and backup logical partitions when configured on the same server as their primary counterparts. Test and development environments. Workloads that run the  operating system and use the file cache. Print servers, file servers, network applications, and other workloads that are less sensitive to I/O latency. Workloads that are inactive most of the time. Workloads with high quality of service criteria. Workloads that consistently consume memory resources due to sustained peak load. High performance computing (HPC) workloads. In addition to the degree to which the memory configuration of a shared memory partition is overcommitted, the following factors can influence the performance of a shared memory partition: The workload that runs in a shared memory partition, the number of virtual adapters that are assigned to the shared memory partition, and the I/O entitled memory set for the shared memory partition all directly affect the performance of I/O devices. These factors can cause I/O devices to operate at their minimum memory requirements rather than their optimal memory requirements. This can cause delays in I/O operations. The amount of I/O entitled memory required for optimal performance depends on the workload and number of adapters configured.  The operating systems that run in shared memory partitions cannot use memory affinity. Some applications rely on memory affinity to improve their performance.  The shared memory partition might be suspended if it attempts to access data on its paging space device when the following situations occur simultaneously:The paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable. For example, you shut down the paging VIOS partition or the paging VIOS partition fails. The shared memory partition is not configured to use redundant paging VIOS partitions to access its paging space device. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related reference:         
 Paging VIOS partition A  (VIOS) logical partition that is assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) provides access to the paging space devices for the logical partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions).  When the operating system that runs in a shared memory partition attempts to access data, and the data is located in the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition, the hypervisor sends a request to a paging VIOS partition to retrieve the data and write it to the shared memory pool so that the operating system can access it. A paging VIOS partition is not a shared memory partition and does not use the memory in the shared memory pool. A paging VIOS partition provides access to the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions. On systems that are managed by the , the management partition is the paging VIOS partition for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool. When you create the shared memory pool, you assign a paging storage pool to the shared memory pool. The paging storage pool provides the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool. On systems that are managed by a  (), you can assign one or two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool. When you assign a single paging VIOS partition to the shared memory pool, the paging VIOS partition provides access to all of the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions. The paging space devices can be located in physical storage in the server or on a storage area network (SAN). When you assign two paging VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool, you can configure each paging VIOS partition to access paging space devices in one of the following ways:You can configure each paging VIOS partition to access independent paging space devices. Paging space devices that are accessed by only one paging VIOS partition, or independent paging space devices, can be located in physical storage in the server or on a SAN. You can configure both paging VIOS partitions to access the same, or common, paging space devices. In this configuration, the paging VIOS partitions provide redundant access to paging space devices. When one paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable, the hypervisor sends a request to the other paging VIOS partition to retrieve the data on the paging space device. Common paging space devices must be located on a SAN to enable symmetrical access from both paging VIOS partitions. You can configure each paging VIOS partition to access some independent paging space devices and some common paging space devices. If you configure the shared memory pool with two paging VIOS partitions, you can configure a shared memory partition to use either a single paging VIOS partition or redundant paging VIOS partitions. When you configure a shared memory partition to use redundant paging VIOS partitions, you assign a primary paging VIOS partition and a secondary paging VIOS partition to the shared memory partition. The hypervisor uses the primary paging VIOS partition to access the shared memory partition's paging space device. At this point, the primary paging VIOS partition is the current paging VIOS partition for the shared memory partition. The current paging VIOS partition is the paging VIOS partition that the hypervisor uses at any point in time to access data in the paging space device that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the primary paging VIOS partition becomes unavailable, the hypervisor uses the secondary paging VIOS partition to access the shared memory partition's paging space device. At this point, the secondary paging VIOS partition becomes the current paging VIOS partition for the shared memory partition and continues as the current paging VIOS partition even after the primary paging VIOS partition becomes available again.  You do not need to assign the same primary and secondary paging VIOS partitions to all of the shared memory partitions. For example, you assign paging VIOS partition A and paging VIOS partition B to the shared memory pool. For one shared memory partition, you can assign paging VIOS partition A as the primary paging VIOS partition and paging VIOS partition B as the secondary paging VIOS partition. For a different shared memory partition, you can assign paging VIOS partition B as the primary paging VIOS partition and paging VIOS partition A as the secondary paging VIOS partition.  The following figure shows an example of a system with four shared memory partitions, two paging VIOS partitions, and four paging space devices. The example shows the configuration options for paging VIOS partitions and paging space devices as described in the following table. Configuration option Example The paging space device that is assigned to a shared memory partition is located in physical storage in the server and is accessed by a single paging VIOS partition. Paging space device 4 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 4. Shared memory partition 4 is assigned to use Paging VIOS partition 2 to access Paging space device 4. Paging space device 4 is located in physical storage in the server and is assigned to Paging VIOS partition 2. Paging VIOS partition 2 is the only paging VIOS partition that can access Paging space device 4 (This relationship is shown by the blue line that connects Paging VIOS partition 2 to Paging space device 4.). The paging space device that is assigned to a shared memory partition is located on a SAN and is accessed by a single paging VIOS partition. Paging space device 1 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 1. Shared memory partition 1 is assigned to use Paging VIOS partition 1 to access Paging space device 1. Paging space device 1 is connected to the SAN. Paging VIOS partition 1 is also connected to the SAN and is the only paging VIOS partition that can access Paging space device 1 (This relationship is shown by the green line that connects Paging VIOS partition 1 to Paging space device 1.). The paging space device that is assigned to a shared memory partition is located on a SAN and is accessed redundantly by two paging VIOS partitions. Paging space device 2 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 2. Paging space device 2 is connected to the SAN. Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2 are also connected to the SAN and can both access Paging space device 2. (These relationships are shown by the green line that connects Paging VIOS partition 1 to Paging space device 2 and the blue line that connects Paging VIOS partition 2 to Paging space device 2.) Shared memory partition 2 is assigned to use redundant paging VIOS partitions to access Paging space device 2. Paging VIOS partition 1 is configured as the primary paging VIOS partition and Paging VIOS partition 2 is configured as the secondary paging VIOS partition. Similarly, Paging space device 3 provides the paging space for Shared memory partition 3. Paging space device 3 is connected to the SAN. Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2 are also connected to the SAN and can both access Paging space device 3. (These relationships are shown by the green line that connects Paging VIOS partition 1 to Paging space device 3 and the blue line that connects Paging VIOS partition 2 to Paging space device 3.) Shared memory partition 3 is assigned to use redundant paging VIOS partitions to access Paging space device 3. Paging VIOS partition 2 is configured as the primary paging VIOS partition and Paging VIOS partition 1 is configured as the secondary paging VIOS partition. Because Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2 both have access to Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3, Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3 are common paging space devices that are accessed redundantly by Paging VIOS partition 1 and Paging VIOS partition 2. If Paging VIOS partition 1 becomes unavailable and Shared memory partition 2 needs to access data on its paging space device, the hypervisor sends a request to Paging VIOS partition 2 to retrieve the data on Paging space device 2. Similarly, if Paging VIOS partition 2 becomes unavailable and Shared memory partition 3 needs to access the data on its paging space device, the hypervisor sends a request to Paging VIOS partition 1 to retrieve the data on Paging space device 3. A paging VIOS partition accesses both independent and common paging space devices. Paging space device 1 and Paging space device 4 are independent paging space devices because only one paging VIOS partition accesses each. Paging VIOS partition 1 accesses Paging space device 1, and Paging VIOS partition 2 accesses Paging space device 4. Paging space device 2 and paging space device 3 are common paging space devices because both paging VIOS partitions access each. (These relationships are shown by the green and blue lines that connect the paging VIOS partitions to the paging space devices.)Paging VIOS partition 1 accesses the independent paging space device Paging space device 1, and also accesses the common paging space devices Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3. Paging VIOS partition 2 accesses the independent paging space device Paging space device 4 and also accesses the common paging space devices Paging space device 2 and Paging space device 3.  When a single paging VIOS partition is assigned to the shared memory pool, you must shut down the shared memory partitions before you shut down the paging VIOS partition so that the shared memory partitions are not suspended when they attempt to access their paging space devices. When two paging VIOS partitions are assigned to the shared memory pool and the shared memory partitions are configured to use redundant paging VIOS partitions, you do not need to shut down the shared memory partitions to shut down a paging VIOS partition. When one paging VIOS partition is shut down, the shared memory partitions use the other paging VIOS partition to access their paging space devices. For example, you can shut down a paging VIOS partition and install VIOS updates without shutting down the shared memory partitions. You can configure multiple VIOS logical partitions to provide access to paging space devices. However, you can only assign up to two of those VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool at any given time. After you configure the shared memory partitions, you can later change the redundancy configuration of the paging VIOS partitions for a shared memory partition by modifying the partition profile of the shared memory partition and restarting the shared memory partition with the modified partition profile: You can change which paging VIOS partitions are assigned to a shared memory partition as the primary and secondary paging VIOS partitions.  You can change the number of paging VIOS partitions that are assigned to a shared memory partition. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks: Related reference:

 Preparing to configure shared memory Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to plan for the shared memory pool, the shared memory partitions, the paging space devices, and the  logical partitions (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions).  Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to determine the size of the shared memory pool, the number of shared memory partitions to assign to the shared memory pool, and the amount of memory to assign to each shared memory partition. Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to determine the size of the shared memory pool, the amount of memory to assign to each shared memory partition, the number of paging space devices to assign to the shared memory pool that you assign to the shared memory pool.

 Preparing to configure shared memory on a system that is managed by the  Before you configure the shared memory pool and create logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions), you need to determine the size of the shared memory pool, the number of shared memory partitions to assign to the shared memory pool, and the amount of memory to assign to each shared memory partition. Before you start, verify that your system meets the requirements for configuring shared memory. For instructions, see . To prepare to configure the shared memory pool and shared memory partitions, complete the following steps:    You can apply the same general guidelines that you might use to assign the desired, minimum, and maximum dedicated memory to logical partitions that use dedicated memory. For example: Do not assign the maximum logical memory to a value that is higher than the amount of logical memory that you plan to dynamically add to the shared memory partition. Set the minimum logical memory to a value that is high enough for the shared memory partition to successfully activate.  For instructions, see .  The paging storage pool can contain paging space devices and virtual disks. However, you cannot use the same logical volume as both a paging space device and as a virtual disk at the same time. Consider reserving an entire storage pool for paging space devices. Optional:  If you do not assign paging space devices to the shared memory pool,  automatically creates them for you from the paging storage pool when you create the shared memory partitions. If you decide to manually create the paging space devices, consider the following requirements:You need to assign a minimum of one paging space device to the shared memory pool for each shared memory partition. For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition that you identified in step 1b.  For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition that you identified in step 1b multiplied by 129/128. For example, you plan to create an  shared memory partition with a maximum logical memory size of 16 GB. The paging space device must be at least 16.125 GB. Parent topic:  Related concepts:         
 Configuration requirements for shared memory Review the requirements for the system,  (VIOS), logical partitions, and paging space devices so that you can successfully configure shared memory. System requirementsThe server must be a  processor-based server. The server firmware must be at release 3.4.2, or later. The  () must be at version 7 release 3.4.2, or later. The  must be at version 2.1.1, or later. The  technology must be activated. The  technology is available with the  for which you must obtain and enter a  activation code.  Paging VIOS partition requirementsVIOS partitions that provide access to the paging space devices for the shared memory partitions that are assigned to the shared memory pool (hereafter referred to as paging VIOS partitions) cannot use shared memory. Paging VIOS partitions must use dedicated memory.  Paging VIOS partitions must be at version 2.1.1, or later. On IVM-managed systems, all logical partitions that use shared memory (hereafter referred to as shared memory partitions) must use virtual resources provided by the management partition. On -managed systems, consider configuring separate VIOS partitions as server partitions and paging VIOS partitions. For example, configure one VIOS partition to provide virtual resources to the shared memory partitions. Then, configure another VIOS partition as a paging VIOS partition. On -managed systems, you can configure multiple VIOS partitions to provide access to paging space devices. However, you can only assign up to two of those VIOS partitions to the shared memory pool at any given time. Requirements for shared memory partitionsShared memory partitions must use shared processors.  You can assign only virtual adapters to shared memory partitions. This means that you can dynamically add only virtual adapters to shared memory partitions. More specifically, the following table lists the virtual adapters that you can assign shared memory partitions.  and  shared memory partitions  shared memory partitions Virtual SCSI client adapters Virtual Ethernet adapters Virtual fibre channel client adapters Virtual serial adapters Virtual SCSI client adapters Virtual Ethernet adapters Virtual fibre channel client adapters Virtual serial server adapters  shared memory partitions Virtual SCSI client adapters Virtual Ethernet adapters Virtual fibre channel client adapters Virtual serial adapters You cannot assign s (HEA) or host connection adapters (HCA) to shared memory partitions. Shared memory partitions cannot use the barrier synchronization register. Shared memory partitions cannot use huge pages.  must be at version 6.1 Technology Level 3, or later, to run in a shared memory partition.  must be at 6.1 with PTF SI32798, to run in a shared memory partition. Virtual OptiConnect must not be enabled on  shared memory partitions.  must be at version 11, or later, to run in a shared memory partition.  Enterprise Server Version 6, or later, to run in a shared memory partition  Logical partitions that provide virtual resources to other logical partitions in a shared memory environment must be VIOS partitions.  Requirements for paging space devicesThe paging space devices for  shared memory partitions must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory of the shared memory partition. The paging space devices for  shared memory partitions must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory of the shared memory partition plus 8 KB for every megabyte. For example, if the maximum logical memory of the shared memory partition is 16 GB, its paging space device must be at least 16.125 GB.  Paging space devices can only be assigned to one shared memory pool at a time. You cannot assign the same paging space device to a shared memory pool on one system and to another shared memory pool on another system at the same time. Paging space devices that are accessed by a single paging VIOS partition must meet the following requirements:They can be physical or logical volumes. They can be located in physical storage on the server or on a storage area network (SAN). Paging space devices that are accessed redundantly by two paging VIOS partitions must meet the following requirements: They must be physical volumes. They must be located on a SAN. They must be configured with global IDs. They must be accessible to both paging VIOS partitions. The reserve attribute must be set to no reserve. (The VIOS automatically sets the reserve attribute to no reserve when you add the paging space device to the shared memory pool.) Physical volumes that are configured as paging space devices cannot belong to a volume group, such as the  volume group.  Logical volumes that are configured as paging space devices must be located in a volume group that is dedicated for paging space devices. Paging space devices must be available. You cannot use the physical volume or logical volume as a paging space device if it is already configured as a paging space device or virtual disk for another logical partition. Paging space devices cannot be used to boot a logical partition. After you assign a paging space device to the shared memory pool, you must manage the device by using one of the following tools: The Create/Modify Shared Memory Pool wizard on the .  The View/Modify Shared Memory Pool page on the .  Do not change or remove the device using other management tools. On logical partitions with the Suspend/Resume feature, paging space devices are used to save suspension data for logical partitions that are configured to use shared memory. The paging space device size must be a minimum of 110% of the maximum memory of the logical partition. Parent topic:  Related concepts: Related tasks:         
 Paging space devices on systems that are managed by an  Learn about the location requirements, size requirements for paging space devices on systems that are managed by a  (). When you configure the shared memory pool, you assign paging space devices to the shared memory pool. Paging space devices can be located in physical storage in the server or on a storage area network (SAN) as follows: Paging space devices that are accessed by a single  (VIOS) logical partition (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) can be located in physical storage in the server or on a SAN. Paging space devices that are accessed redundantly by two paging VIOS partitions, or common paging space devices, must be located on a SAN. When you activate a shared memory partition, the  allocates a paging space device (that is assigned to the shared memory pool) to the shared memory partition. The  allocates only one paging space device to a shared memory partition at a time. When you shut down a shared memory partition, its paging space device becomes available to the  to allocate elsewhere. Thus, the fewest number of paging space devices that must be assigned to the shared memory pool is equal to the number of shared memory partitions that you plan to run simultaneously. After you create the shared memory pool, you can add or remove paging space devices to or from the shared memory pool as needed.  The  assigns paging space devices to shared memory partitions based on the size requirements for the shared memory partition and the redundancy preferences that you specify for partition activation. Size requirementsThe  allocates a paging space device to a shared memory partition that best fits the size requirements of the shared memory partition. For  and  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition.  For  shared memory partitions, the paging space device must be at least the size of the maximum logical memory size of the shared memory partition plus 8 KB for every megabyte.  Shared memory partitions might have several partition profiles that specify different maximum logical memory sizes. To maintain flexibility, consider creating paging space devices that are large enough to be used by shared memory partitions with multiple partition profiles. When you activate a shared memory partition with a different partition profile, the shared memory partition already has a paging space device allocated to it based on the size requirements of the previously activated partition profile. If you create a paging space device that is large enough to meet the size requirements of multiple partition profiles and you activate the shared memory partition with a different partition profile, the  can use the same paging space device for the newly activated partition profile. If the paging space device does not meet the size requirements of the newly activated partition profile, the  frees the paging space device currently allocated to the shared memory partition and allocates a different paging space device that meets the size requirements specified in the newly activated partition profile.  Redundancy preferencesThe  allocates a paging space device to a shared memory partition that satisfies the redundancy preferences that you specify for partition activation: If you specify that the shared memory partition uses redundant paging VIOS partitions, the  uses the following process to select a suitable paging space device for the shared memory partition:The  assigns a paging space device that is common and available. (A paging space device is available when it is not currently assigned to a shared memory partition and is inactive.) If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and available, it reassigns a paging space device that is common and unavailable. (A paging space device is unavailable when it is active and currently assigned to a shared memory partition that is shut down.) If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and unavailable, it cannot activate the shared memory partition. If you specify that the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions, the  uses the following process to select a suitable paging space device for the shared memory partition: The  assigns a paging space device that is independent and available. (A paging space device is independent when it is accessed by only one paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition.) If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and available, the  reassigns a paging space device that is independent and unavailable. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and unavailable, and two paging VIOS partitions are assigned to the shared memory pool, then the  assigns a paging space device that is common and available.  If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and available, and two paging VIOS partitions are assigned to the shared memory pool, then the  reassigns a paging space device that is common and unavailable.  If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and unavailable, it cannot activate the shared memory partition. If you specify that the shared memory partition use redundant paging VIOS partitions, if possible, the  uses the following process to select a suitable paging space device for the shared memory partition:The  assigns a paging space device that is common and available. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and available, it assigns a paging space device that is common and unavailable. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is common and unavailable, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and available to the primary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the primary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and available to the primary paging VIOS partition, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and unavailable to the primary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the primary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and unavailable to the primary paging VIOS partition, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and available to the secondary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the secondary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition. If the  cannot find a paging space device that is independent and available to the secondary paging VIOS partition, it assigns a paging space device that is independent and unavailable to the secondary paging VIOS partition. In this situation, the shared memory partition does not use redundant paging VIOS partitions and the secondary paging VIOS partition is the only paging VIOS partition that is assigned to the shared memory partition.

To add and remove paging space devices, complete the following steps from the :  The Shared Memory Pool wizard is displayed.   Paging space devices can only be assigned to one shared memory pool at a time. You cannot assign the same paging space device to a shared memory pool on one system and to another shared memory pool on another system at the same time.   If you expect to see a particular device on the list of eligible devices to add to the shared memory pool, but the device does not appear, you can run the  command from the  command line. You can run the  command to determine why the device does not meet the requirements for paging space devices and to learn what tasks need to be performed on the device to satisfy the requirements. If a device was used by a logical partition and then the logical partition was removed, the device might not meet the requirements for a paging space device, even though the logical partition was removed. The  command detects this situation and provides instructions about how to change the device so that it meets the requirements for a paging space device. Parent topic:  Related concepts:

 Changing virtual Fibre Channel for a  using the  You can use the  () to dynamically manage virtual Fibre Channel on your managed system and the partition connections for the associated physical Fibre Channel ports. Assigning one or more physical ports to a logical partition enables the partition to communicate with storage devices in a storage area network (SAN). Configuring this type of storage resource is available only when the system supports the use of virtual Fibre Channel adapters and has a physical Fibre Channel adapter installed and connected that supports N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) ports. To assign the virtual Fibre Channel adapter to a physical port, ensure that the client logical partition owns one or more virtual Fibre Channel adapters and that the  owns corresponding virtual Fibre Channel adapters to host the client adapter. To change a port connection assignment for a logical partition, the partition must be either in the  or the  state. If the partition is in the  state, the partition must also be capable of dynamic partitioning (DLPAR). To avoid configuring the physical Fibre Channel adapter to be a single point of failure for the connection between the client logical partition and its physical storage on the SAN, do not connect two virtual Fibre Channel adapters from the same client logical partition to the same physical Fibre Channel adapter. Instead, connect each virtual Fibre Channel adapter to a different physical Fibre Channel adapter. To change virtual Fibre Channel, be sure you meet the following requirements:The  must be at version 7 release 3.4.2 or later. The  must be at version 2.1.1.0 or later.

 Managing logical partitions You can manage the configuration of your logical partitions using the  (). The  allows you to adjust the hardware resources that are used by each logical partition. You can activate many logical partitions at a time by using the  () to activate a system profile. A system profile is an ordered list of partition profiles. When you activate a system profile, the managed system attempts to activate the partition profiles in the system profile in the order in which the partition profiles are listed. You can shut down and restart logical partitions running on systems that are managed by a  (). You can manage the partition profiles for your logical partitions using the  (). You can change the resource specifications stored in your partition profiles as your needs change. You can manage the system profiles on your managed system using the  (). You can change the logical partitions and partition profiles specified within the system profiles as the logical partitions change on your managed system. You use the  () to add, remove, or move processor, memory, and I/O resources between running logical partitions without restarting the logical partitions or the managed system.  Use the  () to manage virtual storage that is associated with  logical partitions. You can use the  () to change the memory configuration of a logical partition. For example, you can  change the memory mode of a logical partition, and dynamically add and remove dedicated or shared memory to and from a logical partition. When all of the worldwide port names (WWPNs) on the server are used, you can add more WWPNs to the server using the  (). Adding WWPNs allows you to create additional virtual Fibre Channel adapters on client logical partitions that use virtual resources provided by the . To avoid shutting down mission-critical workloads when your server firmware deconfigures a failing processor, you can use the  () to set partition-availablity priorities for the logical partitions on your managed system. A logical partition with a failing processor can acquire a replacement processor from logical partitions with a lower partition-availability priority. The acquisition of a replacement processor allows the logical partition with the higher partition-availability priority to continue running after a processor failure. It is crucial that you back up your data because you never know when you might need to do a server recovery. Save everything in your system as often as possible. You might not be prepared to recover from a site loss or certain types of disk failures if you do not regularly save everything. You can manage logical partitions that use  virtual I/O resources to help maximize utilization of the physical hardware and simplify the backup procedure for your managed system.

 Activating a logical partition You can use the  () to activate a logical partition based on its current configuration instead of a partition profile. When you activate the logical partition, the system commits resources to the logical partition based on the current configuration of the logical partition and starts the operating system or software that is installed on the logical partition. Logical partitions start faster when activated based on their current configuration data than when activated with a partition profile. You can view the resource configuration status of a logical partition by using the  ().  On a  () that is at Version 7 Release 7.8.0, or later, you can apply a profile to a logical partition without powering on the logical partition by using the  command-line interface.

 Activating a partition profile  A partition profile is a record on the  that specifies a possible configuration for a logical partition. If you plan to activate a logical partition that uses virtual resources provided by the , you must first activate the  () logical partition that provides the virtual resources. If you plan to activate a logical partition that uses shared memory (hereafter referred to as a shared memory partition), you must first activate at least one  logical partition that meets the following criteria: The  logical partition (hereafter referred to as a paging VIOS partition) must provide access to an available paging space device that meets the size requirements of the shared memory partition. The paging VIOS partition must be assigned to the shared memory pool. If the shared memory partition is configured with redundant paging  partitions, activate both paging  partitions before you activate the shared memory partition. When you activate a shared memory partition and the shared memory pool does not contain enough physical memory required for activation, you can release to the hypervisor the physical memory that is currently assigned to other shared memory partitions that are shut down. The hypervisor can then assign the released physical memory to the shared memory partition that you want to activate.

 Power-on self-test keys The power-on self-test (POST) keys can start services or initiate service mode boots used for configuring the system and diagnosing problems. After power is turned on and before the operating system is loaded, the system does a power-on self-test (POST). This test performs checks to ensure that the hardware is functioning correctly before the operating system is loaded. During the POST, a POST screen is displayed, and POST indicators appear on the firmware console (if one is connected). The POST keys, if pressed after the keyboard POST indicator is displayed and before the last POST indicator speaker is displayed, cause the system to start services or to initiate service mode boots used for configuring the system and diagnosing problems.  The program function keys (F1-F12) on a keyboard attached to the service processor are not used and are ignored. After the keyboard POST indicator is displayed, you must use the numeric number keys. The numeric 1 key, when pressed during POST, starts the system management services interface. The numeric 5 key, when pressed during POST, initiates a system boot in service mode using the default service mode boot list. This mode attempts to boot from the first device of each type found in the list. It does not search for other bootable devices of that type if the first device is not bootable. Instead, it continues to the next device type in the list.   The default boot sequence is:  Diskette (if installed) CD-ROM (if installed) Tape drive (if installed) Hard file Network  The numeric 6 key works like the numeric 5 key. Parent topic:     |

 cfgdev command Purpose Configures devices in the .   Syntax cfgdev [  Name ]   Description The cfgdev command configures devices. If there are any devices detected that have no device software installed when configuring devices, the cfgdev command returns a warning message with the name or a list of possible names for the device package that must be installed. If the specific name of the device package is determined, it is displayed as the only package name, on a line below the warning message. If the specific name cannot be determined, a colon-separated list of possible package names is displayed on a single line. A package name or list of possible package names is displayed for each of the devices, if more than one device is detected without its device software.  The system displays the following warning message when devices without their device software are detected: cfgdev: 0514-621 WARNING: The following device packages are         required for device support but are not currently          installed. devices.pci.22100020 devices.pci.14101800 devices.pci.scsi:devices.pci.00100300:devices.pci.NCR.53C825  In this example, two devices were found that had missing software, and the cfgdev command displayed the names of the device packages that must be installed. A third device that also has missing software was found, but in this case, the cfgdev command displays several possible device package names.   To protect the Configuration database, the cfgdev command is not interruptible. Stopping this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.   Flags Flag name Description -dev Name Specifies the named device to configure along with its children.   Exit Status See .

 chdev command Purpose Changes the characteristics of a device.   Syntax chdev   Name [ ]  Attribute=Value... [] [] chdev  Udid [ ]  Attribute=Value... [] []   Description The chdev command changes the characteristics of the device specified with the given device logical name (the -dev Name flag).  Some changes may not be allowed when the device is in the Available state.  When the -perm flag is not specified, the chdev command applies the changes to the device and updates the database to reflect the changes. If the -perm flag is specified, only the database is updated to reflect the changes, and the device itself is left unchanged. This is useful in cases where a device cannot be changed because it is in use; in which case, the changes can be made to the database with the -perm flag, and the changes will be applied to the device when the system is restarted. Not all devices support the -perm flag.    To protect the Configuration database, the chdev command is not interruptible. To stop this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.  The lldpsvc attribute is added to the shared Ethernet adapter (SEA) device for an automated virtual network port configuration and management in the  () Version 7 Release 7.7.0, or later. The lldpsvc attribute activates the virtual server network (VSN) capability on the SEA when you set the attribute to yes. The VSN capability can be enabled on the . The default value of the lldpsvc attribute is no. This attribute must be set to no before you remove the SEA. Flags Flag name Description -attr Attribute=Value Specifies the device attribute value pairs used for changing specific attribute values. The Attribute=Value parameter can use one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be separated by spaces. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2 lists more than one attribute value pair. -dev Name Specifies the device logical name, indicated by the Name parameter, whose characteristics are to be changed. -force  Forcefully attempts to change the device attribute. Currently supports network interface and inet0 family. -perm Changes the characteristics of the device permanently without actually changing the device. This is useful for devices that cannot be made unavailable and cannot be changed while in the available state.  By restarting the system, the changes will be applied to the device. Not all devices support the -perm flag. -restoreroute Restores routes. -udid Specifies the unique device identifier (UDID).  You cannot change attributes of the interface or the inet0 family that is used for the cluster communication. You can change the attributes by using the force option. However, this can adversely affect the membership of the cluster.   Exit StatusSee .   Examples To change the retention instructions of the 4mm SCSI tape drive rmt0 so that the drive does not move the tape to the beginning, then to the end, and then back to the beginning each time a tape is inserted or the drive is powered on, type the command as follows: chdev -dev rmt0 -attr ret=no    To change the SCSI ID of the available SCSI adapter scsi0 that cannot be made unavailable or changed due to available disk drives connected to it, type: chdev  -dev scsi0 -attr id=6 -perm  To apply the change to the adapter, shutdown and restart the system.  To restore the route, type the command as follows:chdev  -restoreroute  If you attempt to change a route by typing the following command when it is in use for the cluster communication, the system displays an error message:chdev -dev inet0 -attr route="net,-hopcount,0,,0,9.126.85.2" The system displays the following error message with return code 78:The requested operation is not allowed because partition is a member of "test_cluster" cluster.

 chpath command PurposeChanges the operational status of paths to a MultiPath I/O (MPIO) capable device, or changes an attribute associated with a path to an MPIO capable device.   Syntax chpath  Name  OpStatus [  Parent ] [  Connection ]   chpath  Name  Parent [  Connection ] [  ]  Attribute=Value...   Description The chpath command either changes the operational status of paths to the specified device (the -dev Name flag) or it changes one, or more, attributes associated with a specific path to the specified device. The required syntax is slightly different depending upon the change being made.  The first syntax shown above changes the operational status of one or more paths to a specific device. The set of paths to change is obtained by taking the set of paths which match the following criteria: The target device matches the specified device. The parent device matches the specified parent (-pdev Parent), if a parent is specified. The connection matches the specified connection (-conn Connection), if a connection is specified. The path status is PATH_AVAILABLE  The operational status of a path refers to the usage of the path as part of MPIO path selection. The value of enable indicates that the path is to be used while disable indicates that the path is not to be used. It should be noted that setting a path to disable impacts future I/O, not I/O already in progress. As such, a path can be disabled, but still have outstanding I/O until such time that all of the I/O that was already in progress completes. As such, if -op disable is specified for a path and I/O is outstanding on the path, this fact will be displayed.  Disabling a path affects path selection at the device driver level. The path_status of the path is not changed in the device configuration database. The lspath command must be used to see current operational status of a path.  The second syntax shown above changes one or more path specific attributes associated with a particular path to a particular device. Note that multiple attributes can be changed in a single invocation of the chpath command; but all of the attributes must be associated with a single path. In other words, you cannot change attributes across multiple paths in a single invocation of the chpath command. To change attributes across multiple paths, separate invocations of chpath are required; one for each of the paths that are to be changed.   Flags Flag name Description -attr Attribute=Value Identifies the attribute to change as well as the new value for the attribute. The Attribute is the name of a path specific attribute. The Value is the value which is to replace the current value for the Attribute.  The Attribute=Value parameter can use one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be enclosed in quotation marks with spaces between the pairs. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr 'Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2' lists more than one attribute value pair. -dev Name Specifies the logical device name of the target device for the path(s) affected by the change. This flag is required in all cases. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device to use in qualifying the paths to be changed. This flag is required when changing attributes, but is optional when change operational status. -perm Changes the path's characteristics without actually changing the path. The change takes effect on the path the next time the path is unconfigured and then configured (possibly on the next boot). -conn Connection Indicates the connection information to use in qualifying the paths to be changed. This flag is optional when changing operational status. When changing attributes, it is optional if the device has only one path to the indicated parent. If there are multiple paths from the parent to the device, then this flag is required to identify the specific path being changed. -op OpStatus Indicates the operational status to which the indicated paths should be changed. The operational status of a path is maintained at the device driver level. It determines if the path will be considered when performing path selection.The allowable values for this flag are:  enable  Mark the operational status as enabled for MPIO path selection. A path with this status will be considered for use when performing path selection. Note that enabling a path is the only way to recover a path from a failed condition.  disable  Mark the operational status as disabled for MPIO path selection. A path with this status will not be considered for use when performing path selection.  This flag is required when changing operational status. When used in conjunction with the -attr Attribute=Value flag, a usage error is generated.   Exit Status See .   ExamplesTo disable the paths between scsi0 and the hdisk1 disk device, enter: chpath -dev hdisk1 -pdev scsi0 -op disable The system displays a message similar to one of the following: paths disabled  or some paths disabled The first message indicates that all PATH_AVAILABLE paths from scsi0 to hdisk1 have been successfully enabled. The second message indicates that only some of the PATH_AVAILABLE paths from scsi0 to hdisk1 have been successfully disabled.

 cpvdi command Purpose Copies a block device.   Syntax cpvdi  input_disk_image   output_disk_image [ input_storage_pool] [ output_storage_pool] []    Description The cpvdi command copies a block device image, which can be either a logical or physical volume, a file-backed device, or a file on another existing disk.  The parameters of the -src and -dst flags should be fully qualified names when specifying a file or device. Specifying the -progress flag prints a number sign (#) on the stderr for each block (1 M) of data copied on to the destination.  The output_disk_image device that you specify with the -dst flag cannot be a physical volume that is assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).   Flags Flag name Description -src input_disk_image 	 Specifies the input backing device.  The input backing device might either be a physical or logical volume or a file is located in the caller's home directory, any of its subdirectories or in the /mnt directory.  The root user will not have any file location restrictions.       -dst output_disk_image Specifies the output backing device.  The output backing device might either be a physical or logical volume or a file is located in the caller's home directory, any of its subdirectories or in the /mnt directory.  The root user will not have any file location restrictions. -f  Overwrites the destination file. However, if the source or destination file is configured as backing device, it copies the file without unconfiguring the device or devices. If the -unconfigure flag is used in addition to the -f flag, then the -unconfigure flag takes priority. -progress Specifies the process status of the command will be expressed by printing a number sign (#) to stderr for every 1024 KB block of data that has been copied. -isp input_storage_pool Specifies the name of the storage pool where the input file-backed device exists. Required if the argument of the -src flag is a file-backed device. -osp output_storage_pool Specifies the name of the storage pool where the input file-backed device exists. Required if the argument of the -dst flag is a file-backed device. -overwrite  Overwrites the destination file, if the file is present. If you do not use this flag, an error message displays with a non-zero exit code. -unconfigure  Specifies to unconfigure the virtual target device (VTD) and reconfigure the VTD after a copy operation. Only use this flag if the source or destination file is configured as backing device. If you do not use this flag, an error message displays with a non-zero exit code.   Exit Status See .   Examples To copy a physical volume disk image to a file, type the following command: cpvdi -src hdisk1 -dst /home/my_home/image1_file   To copy a disk image that is a file to a physical volume, type the following command: cpvdi -src /home/my_home/image2_file -dst hdisk2 To output a hash symbol for every block of data that is copied, type the following command:  cpvdi -src hdisk1 -dst hdisk2 -progress To copy a file-backed device to another file-backed device, type the following command: cpvdi -src image1_file -dst image2_file -isp sp01 -osp sp02 To copy a file1 to file2, when file2 already exists, type the following command: cpvdi -src /home/padmin/file1 -dst /home/padmin/file2 -overwrite To copy a file-backed device fbd1 as fbd2, when fbd1 is configured as the backing device, type the following command: cpvdi -src fbd1 -dst fbd2 -isp sp01 -osp sp01 -f   Related Information The  command.

 lsmap command Purpose Displays the mapping between physical, logical, and virtual devices.   Syntax lsmap { ServerVirtualAdapter |  PhysicalLocationCode |  } [  BackingDeviceType  |  | ] [ FieldName ... ] [ Delimiter ]   lsmap  {  PagingDevice |  } [  BackingDeviceType ] [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]  lsmap  ClusterName { |  HostName} [ FieldName...  ] [  Delimiter ] lsmap  { ServerVirtualAdapter |  } [  BackingDeviceType ] [ FieldName ... ] [ Delimiter ] lsmap  ClusterName { |   HostName} Description The  command displays the mapping between the virtual host adapters and the physical devices they are backed to. Given an adapter name (ServerVirtualAdapter) or physical location code (PhysicalLocationCode) of a server virtual adapter, the device name of each connected virtual target device (child devices), its logical unit number, backing device(s), and the backing devices physical location code is displayed. If the -net flag is specified the supplied device must be a virtual server Ethernet adapter.  The -fmt flag separates the output by a user-specified delimiter/character (delimiter). The delimiter can be any non-white space character. This format is provided to facilitate scripting. When a field has no value, it is reported as a "space/blank". For example, if vhost0 has a vtopt0 entry, with no backing device, and you type the command lsmap -vadapter vhost0 -fmt : -field VTD backing status, the system displays the following output vtopt0: :Available. The -type flag limits the types of backing devices displayed to the user-specified list, BackingDeviceType.  With the exception of the net type, any combination of device types may be specified.  The net type cannot be combined with any other type.  The -npiv flag displays the server binding information between the virtual fibre channel and the physical fibre channel adapter. It is also used to display client adapter attributes that are sent to the server adapter.  The -suspend flag displays the storage that is used by a suspended client. The  command can be used to remove suspended adapters. For more information, see the Examples section of the  command topic.   Flags Flag name Description -all Specifies that the mapping information must be displayed for all the virtual SCSI devices. If the -all flag is used with the -net flag, virtual Ethernet adapters are displayed. If the flag is used with the -npiv flag, virtual fibre channel adapters are displayed. If the flag is used with the -suspend flag, suspended virtual small computer system interface (VSCSI) adapters are displayed. -ams Displays paging space device information used in active memory sharing. -clustername Specifies the cluster name. -field FieldName Specifies the list of fields to display.  The order that you specify the attributes is not guaranteed to be the same order as they are returned. The attributes of the virtual host adapter (vhostX) are always listed before the attributes of the virtual target device (VTD). You can specify the order of the attributes within the virtual host adapter and the order of the attributes within the virtual target device. But, you cannot intermix the attributes of the virtual host adapter and the attributes of the virtual target device. For virtual SCSI (default), the following fields are supported:svsa Server virtual adapter name. physloc The physical location code of the server's virtual adapter. mirrored  The backing device is part of a Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) pair. clientid Client partition ID. vtd Virtual target device. lun Logical unit number.  backing  Backing device. bdphysloc The physical location code of the backing device. status Virtual target device status.

 lsnports command Purpose Lists available ports that are capable of N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) and related information.   Syntax lsnports [  Delimiter ] [  Fieldname ]   Description The  command displays information for all the ports capable of NPIV. If you use the name of the adapter driver (for a particular physical port) in the vfcmap command, the map_port attribute is set for a virtual fibre channel adapter on the server logical partition. This attribute maps the virtual fibre channel adapter on the server logical partition to a physical fibre channel port.   Without a flag, information is displayed in a column. Specifying the -fmt flag formats the output with a specified delimiter. If no NPIV ports are in the Virtual I/O Server logical partition, the error code E_NO_NPIV_PORTS(62) is displayed.    Flags Flag name Description -fmt delimiter Specifies a delimiter character to separate output fields. -field Specifies a list of fields to be displayed. The following fields are supported: name Physical port name physloc  Physical port location code fabric  Fabric support tports  Total number of NPIV ports aports  Number of available NPIV ports swwpns Total number of target worldwide port names supported awwpns  Number of target worldwide port names available   Output Field Definitions Field Description name Physical port name physloc Physical port location code fabric Fabric support tports Total number of NPIV ports aports Number of available NPIV ports swwpns Total number of target worldwide port names supported awwpns Number of target worldwide port names available   Exit Status Return code Description 62 System does not have ports capable of NPIV.

 lspath command Purpose Displays information about paths to a MultiPath I/O (MPIO) capable device.   Syntax lspath [  DeviceName ] [  Parent ] [  Status ] [  Connection ] [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]  lspath  DeviceName   Parent [  Connection ]   [  Attribute... ] [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]  lspath  DeviceName   Parent [  Connection ]   Attribute [  FieldName ... ] [  Delimiter ]   Description The lspath command displays one of three types of information about paths to an MPIO capable device. It either displays the operational status for one or more paths to a single device, or it displays one or more attributes for a single path to a single MPIO capable device. The first syntax shown above displays the operational status for one or more paths to a particular MPIO capable device.  The second syntax displays one or more attributes for a single path to a particular MPIO capable device. Finally, the third syntax displays the possible range of values for an attribute for a single path to a particular MPIO capable device.   	  Displaying Path Status with the lspath Command 	When displaying path status, the set of paths to display is obtained by 	searching the device configuration database for paths that match the following 	criteria: 	The target device name matches the device specified with the -dev flag. If the -dev flag is not present, then 	the target device is not used in the criteria.  The parent device name matches the device specified with the -pdev flag. If the -pdev flag is not present, then 	parent is not used in the criteria.  The connection matches the connection specified with the -conn flag. If the -conn flag is not present, then 	connection is not used in the criteria. The path status matches status specified with the -status flag. If the -status flag is not present, the 	path status is not used in the criteria.  	If none of the -dev, -pdev, -conn, or -status flags are specified, 	then all paths known to the system are displayed.  	By default, this command will display the information in columnar form. 	When no flags are specified that qualify the paths to display, the format 	of the output is: 	status device  parent 	  	Possible values that can appear for the status column are: 	enabled  Indicates that the path is configured and operational. It will be considered 	when paths are selected for IO. disabled  Indicates that the path is configured, but not currently operational. 	It has been manually disabled and will not be considered when paths are selected 	for IO. failed  Indicates that the path is configured, but it has had IO failures that 	have rendered it unusable. It will not be considered when paths are selected 	for IO. defined Indicates that the path has not been configured into the device driver. missing  Indicates that the path was defined in a previous boot, but it was not 	detected in the most recent boot of the system.  detected  Indicates that the path was detected in the most recent boot of the 	system, but for some reason it was not configured. A path should only have 	this status during boot and so this status should never appear as a result 	of the lspath command.  	 Displaying Path Attributes with the lspath Command 	When displaying attributes for a path, the path must be fully qualified. 	Multiple attributes for a path can be displayed, but attributes belonging 	to multiple paths cannot be displayed in a single invocation of the lspath command. Therefore, in addition to the -lsattr, -dev, and -pdev flags, 	the -conn flags are required to uniquely identify a 	single path. For example: 	if only one path between a device and a specific parent, the -conn flag is not required if there are multiple paths between a device and a specific parent, the -conn flag is required  	Furthermore, the -status flag is not allowed.  	By default, this command will display the information in columnar form. 	attribute   value    description         user_settable  	 Flags Flag name Description -attr Attribute Identifies the specific attribute to list. The 'Attribute' is the name of a path specific attribute. When this flag is provided, only the identified attribute is displayed. Multiple instances of this flag may be used to list multiple attributes. If this flag is not specified at all, all attributes associated with the identified path will be listed.  -lsattr Displays the attribute names, current values, descriptions, and user-settable flag values for a specific path.  -dev Name Specifies the logical device name of the target device whose path information is to be displayed. -field FieldNames Specifies the list of fields to display. The following fields are supported: status  Status of the path name  Name of the device parent  Name of the parent device conn Path connection. -fmt Delimiter Specifies a delimiter character to separate output fields. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device of the path(s) to be displayed.  -range Displays the legal values for an attribute name. The -range flag displays the list attribute values in a vertical column as follows: Value1 Value2 . . ValueN The -range flag displays the range attribute values as x...n(+i) where x is the start of the range, n is the end of the range, and i is the increment.  -status Status The -status Status flag indicates the status to use in qualifying the paths to be displayed. When displaying path information, the allowable values for this flag are: enabled Display paths that are enabled for MPIO path selection. disabled Display paths that are disabled from MPIO path selection. failed Display paths that are failed due to IO errors.  available Display paths whose path_status is PATH_AVAILABLE (that is, paths that are configured in the system, includes enabled, disabled, and failed paths). defined Display paths whose path_status is PATH_DEFINED. missing Display paths whose path_status is PATH_MISSING. -conn Connection Indicates the connection information to use in qualifying the paths to be displayed.    Exit Status Return code Description 1 Invalid status value.   Examples To display, without column headers, the set of paths whose operational status is disabled, enter: lspath -status disabled The system will display a message similar to the following:   disabled  hdisk1   scsi1  disabled  hdisk2   scsi1  disabled  hdisk23  scsi8  disabled  hdisk25  scsi8 To display the set of paths whose operational status is failed, enter:  lspath -status failed  The system will display a message similar to the following:    failed  hdisk1   scsi1  failed  hdisk2   scsi1  failed  hdisk23  scsi8  failed  hdisk25  scsi8 If the target device is a SCSI disk, to display all attributes for the path to parent  scsi0 at connection 5,0, use the command:  lspath -dev hdisk10 -pdev scsi0 -conn "5,0" -lsattr The system will display a message similar to the following:  weight     1      Order of path failover selection  true         Related Information The  command, the  command, the  command, and the  command.

 mkkrb5clnt command Purpose Configures a Kerberos client. Syntax To configure Kerberos against  Network Authentication Service only:  mkkrb5clnt   | [   KDC   Realm   Server   [  Admin ]   Domain [   ] [   Database ] [  ] [   ] [  ticket_lifetime ] [  renew_lifetime ] ] [  {ldapserver | ldapserver:port} ]  To configure Kerberos against non-kadmind services:  mkkrb5clnt -h | -c KDC -r Realm -s Server -d Domain [ -i Database ] [ -K ] [ -t ticket_lifetime ] [ -n renew_lifetime ]  [ -l {ldapserver | ldapserver:port} ] | -U Description This command configures the Kerberos client. The first part of the command reads realm name, KDC, VDB path, and domain name from the input and generates a krb5.conf file.  Item Description /etc/krb5/krb5.conf: Values for realm name, Kerberos admin server, and domain name are set as specified on the command line. Also updates the paths for default_keytab_name, kdc, and kadmin log files.  If DCE is not configured, this command creates a link to /etc/krb5/krb5.conf from /etc/krb5.conf.  The command also allows you to configure root as admin user, configure integrated Kerberos authentication, and configure  Kerberos as default authentication scheme.  For integrated login, the -i flag requires the name of the database being used. For LDAP, use the load module name that specifies LDAP. For local files, use the keyword files.  Item Description Standard Output Consists of information messages when the -h flag is used. Standard Error Consists of error messages when the command cannot complete successfully. Flags  Item Description -a Admin Specifies the principal name of the Kerberos server admin. -A Specifies root to be added as a Kerberos administrative user. -c KDC Specifies the KDC server. -d Domain Specifies the complete domain name for the Kerberos client. -D Specifies Kerberos against non-kadmind services. -h Specifies that the command is only to display the valid command syntax. -i Database Configures integrated Kerberos authentication. -K Specifies Kerberos to be configured as the default authentication scheme. -l ldapserver | ldapserver:port For servers, specifies the LDAP directory used to store the Network Authentication Service principal and policy information. For clients, specifies the LDAP directory server to use for Administration server and KDC discovery using LDAP. If the -l flag is used, then the KDC and server flags are optional. If the -l option is not used, the KDC and server flags must be specified. The port number can optionally be specified.  For clients and servers, the port number can optionally be specified. If the port number is not specified, the client connects to the default LDAP server port 389 or 636 for SSL connections.   Only the client configuration is updated. -n renew_lifetime Specifies the client-specific time to generate a renewable ticket if the server supports it. By default, the ticket is nonrenewable. The renew_lifetime parameter value is composed of four numeric values that are delimited by colons. -r Realm Specifies the full realm name for which the Kerberos client is to be configured. -s Server Specifies the fully qualified host name for Kerberos admin server. -t ticket_lifetime Specifies the client-specific ticket lifetime for received tickets if the server supports it. If you do not specify the flag, the server sets the ticket lifetime. The ticket_lifetime parameter value is composed of four numeric values that are delimited by colons. -T Specifies the flag to acquire server admin TGT based admin ticket. -U Undo the setup from the previous configuration command.

 mkpath command Purpose Adds to the system another path to an MPIO capable device.   Syntax mkpath { [ -dev Name ] [  Parent ] [  Connection ] } [  ]   Description The mkpath command defines, and possibly configures, one or more paths to the target device (-dev Name). The paths are identified by a combination of the -dev Name, -pdev Parent, and -conn Connection flags. Both the target device and parent must be previously defined in the system to define a path. They both must be AVAILABLE to configure a path.  If the -def flag is specified, the mkpath command only defines the new path definition to the system. If the -def flag is not specified, the mkpath command attempts to define the path, if it does not already exist, before it attempts to configure the path. Configuring a path requires the path to already be defined and both the device and the parent device to already be configured.  The mkpath command displays a status message upon completion. It is possible for some paths to configure and others to fail.  Note that not all devices will be able to have paths manually defined by using the mkpath command. These limitations are due to the way that path information is stored for these devices. Fiber channel devices fall into this category.  The mkpath command provides status messages about the results of operation. Messages in one of the following formats will be generated: path [ available | defined ]  This message is displayed when mkpath is run on a single path. If the path is successfully configured the message path available is displayed. If the path is not successfully configured and there is no explicit error code returned by the method, the message path defined is displayed. paths available  This message is displayed if multiple paths were identified and all paths were successfully configured.  some paths available  This message is displayed if multiple paths were identified, but only some of them were successfully configured.  no paths processed  This message is generated if no paths were found matching the selection criteria.   Flags Flag name Description -conn Connection Indicates the connection information associated with the path to be added. This flag is required if the -def flag is specified. -def Defines a new path to a device by adding a path definition to the system. The new path will not automatically be configured when the -def flag is specified. Note that only one path may be defined at a time. The -conn and the -pdev flags are required when the -def flag is used. -dev Name Specifies the logical device name of the target device to which the path(s) are being added. The path(s) to be added are qualified by the -pdev and -conn flags. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device associated with the path(s) to be added. This flag is required if the -def flag is specified.   Exit Status See .   Examples To define and configure an already defined path between scsi0 and the hdisk1 device at SCSI ID 5 and LUN 0 (connection 5,0), enter: mkpath -dev hdisk1 -pdev scsi0 -conn 5,0 The system displays the following message: path available   To configure an already defined path from fscsi0 to fiber channel disk hdisk1, type: mkpath -dev hdisk1 -pdev fscsi0 The system displays the following message: path available    To only add to the Customized Paths object class a path definition between scsi0 and the hdisk1 disk device at SCSI ID 5 and LUN 0, enter: mkpath -def -dev hdisk1 -pdev scsi0 -conn 5,0 The system displays the following message: path defined      Related InformationThe  command and the  command.

 mkvdev command Purpose Adds a virtual device to the system.   Syntax To create a virtual target device:  mkvdev [  ] {  TargetDevice |  TDPhysicalLocationCode } {  VirtualServerAdapter |  VSAPhysicalLocationCode}  [  DeviceName ]  To create a virtual target device for a file backed virtual optical device:  mkvdev   {  VirtualServerAdapter |  VSAPhysicalLocationCode }  [ DeviceName]  To create a virtual target device when the backup device is part of a Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) pair: mkvdev [  ] {  TargetDevice |  TDPhysicalLocationCode } {  VirtualServerAdapter |  VSAPhysicalLocationCode} {  mirrored=true } [  DeviceName ] To create a shared Ethernet adapter:  mkvdev [  TargetDevice  VirtualEthernetAdapter... DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter   SEADefaultPVID [  Attribute=Value  [ Attribute=Value... ]] [ []]  The shared Ethernet adapter attributes, ha_mode and ctl_chan, must be specified together. The command fails if only one attribute is specified. These attributes are used to create a shared Ethernet adapter in a failover configuration.  To create an Link Aggregation adapter:  mkvdev TargetAdapter... [  Attribute=Value [ Attribute=Value... ] ] [   [ -interface TargetInterface ] ]  To create a VLAN Ethernet adapter:  mkvdev   TargetAdapter  TagID   Description The mkvdev command creates a virtual device.  The name of the virtual device is automatically generated and assigned unless the -dev DeviceName flag is specified, in which case DeviceName becomes the device name.  If the backup device is part of a PPRC pair, set the mirrored attribute to TRUE to create the virtual target device.  This allows a  PPRC secondary device to be exported to the client partition. If the -lnagg flag is specified, a Link Aggregation or IEEE 802.3 Link Aggregation (automatic Link Aggregation) device is created. To create an IEEE 802.3 Link Aggregation set the mode attribute to 8023ad. If the -sea flag is specified, a shared Ethernet adapter is created. The TargetDevice may be a Link Aggregation adapter (note, however, that the VirtualEthernetAdapter  may not be Link Aggregation adapters). The default virtual Ethernet adapter, DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter, must also be included as one of the virtual Ethernet adapters, VirtualEthernetAdapter.    The -vlan flag is used to create a VLAN device and the -vdev flag creates a virtual target device which maps the VirtualServerAdapter to the TargetDevice.  If the backup device that is specified by the -vdev or -dplc flags is already in use, an error is returned unless the -f flag is also specified.   The mkvdev command also configures virtual optical devices, where the -vdev or -dplc flag specifies the physical optical device and the -vadapter or -aplc flag specifies the virtual SCSI adapter. If the specified optical device is already assigned to a virtual SCSI adapter, an error is returned unless the -f flag is also specified. If the -f flag is specified, the optical device will be removed from the virtual SCSI adapter it is currently assigned to before reassigning it to the new virtual SCSI adapter. When an additional disk drive that has a lower max_transfer_size than the current setting is added, and it is set as a virtual target device (processing mkvdev), the client cannot recognize this device until the VIOS is rebooted and the max_transfer_size is reestablished to the new setting. Because the max_transfer_size cannot be dynamically changed, the mkvdev  command checks the current max_transfer_size of the device being added. If it is lower, it posts a message stating that the VIOS must be rebooted before the client can see this device.   To protect the Configuration Database, the mkvdev command is not interruptible. Stopping this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.   Flags Flag name Description -aplc VSAPhysicalLocationCode Specifies the virtual SCSI adapter using the physical location code -attr Attribute=Value Specifies the device attribute value pairs to be used instead of the defaults. The Attribute=Value variable can be used to specify one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be enclosed in quotation marks with a blank space between the pairs. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr 'Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2' lists more than one attribute value pair.  -auto Migrates and restores the Ethernet interface when you create a shared Ethernet adapter with the -migrate option. -default DefaultVirtualEthernetAdapter  Default virtual adapter to use for non-VLAN-tagged packets.  This flag maps to the shared Ethernet adapter device attribute pvid_adapter. -defaultid SEADefaultPVID  The SEADefaultPVID is the VID used for untagged frames.  All untagged packets are assigned the SEADefaultPVID value.   When a tagged frame is received by a port, the tag is used.  Otherwise if the frame is untagged, the value contained in the PVID is considered as a tag.  This flag maps to the shared Ethernet adapter device attribute pvid. -dev DeviceName By using the -dev flag, you can specify the name you want the device to be known by. If you do not use the -dev flag, a name will be automatically generated and assigned. Not all devices support user-supplied names. -dplc TDPhysicalLocationCode Specifies the physical device using the physical location code -f Force the physical volume specified to be used as a backup device, even if it's already associated with a virtual SCSI adapter. If the specified backup device is an optical device, -f forces the optical device to be removed from the virtual SCSI adapter to which it is currently assigned, before reassigning it to the new virtual SCSI adapter. The -f flag can also be used to force the mkvdev command to continue working when it fails, because the device is in use as a cluster device. The user must know every host to which the disk is visible and how it is used, before forcing the mkvdev command to continue working. -fbo Create a virtual optical device. -lnagg TargetAdapter... Creates a Link Aggregation device. -migrate Migrates the settings from the physical adapter interface to the shared Ethernet adapter interface. -sea TargetDevice  Creates a shared Ethernet adapter which maps VirtualEthernetAdapter  to the adapter TargetDevice.  TargetDevice can be a physical adapter or a Link Aggregation adapter. -tagid TagID Specifies the VLAN tag ID. -vadapter VirtualEthernetAdapter or VirtualServerAdapter Specifies the virtual server adapter or virtual Ethernet adapter the new device will be mapped to. If multiple virtual Ethernet adapters are specified, separate the adapter names with commas and no spaces.  -vdev TargetDevice  Creates a virtual device mapped to the physical/logical device TargetDevice and the virtual server adapter VirtualServerAdapter. The TargetDevice can be either a physical volume, logical volume, USB HD, or optical device. Physical volumes assigned to volume groups cannot be used as target devices. -vlan TargetAdapter Creates a Virtual Local Area Network device.    While you create the shared Ethernet adapter, -auto and -migrate options do not support the migration of an IPv6 stateless configuration.   Exit Status Return code Description 13 Specified physical or logical volume is not a valid. 21 Device is already in use. Use the -f flag to force assignment. 22 Logical volumes cannot be assigned as backup devices more than once.   Examples To create a virtual target device that maps the logical volume lv20 as a virtual disk for a client partition hosted by the vhost0 virtual server adapter, type the following command: mkvdev -vdev lv20 -vadapter vhost0 The system displays the following message: vtscsi0 available To create a virtual target device that maps the physical volume hdisk6 as a virtual disk for a client partition served by the vhost2 virtual server adapter, type the following command: mkvdev -vdev hdisk6 -vadapter vhost2 The system displays the following message: vtscsi1 available To create a virtual target device that maps physical tape device rmt0 as a virtual tape device for a client partition served by the vhost2 virtual server adapter, type the following command:   mkvdev -vdev rmt0 -vadapter vhost2 The system displays the following message: vttape0 available To create a shared Ethernet adapter that maps the physical Ethernet adapter ent4 as a virtual Ethernet adapter for the client partitions served by the virtual Ethernet adapters ent6, ent7, and ent9, using ent6 as the default adapter and 8 as the default ID, type the following command: mkvdev -sea ent4 -vadapter ent6 ent7 ent9 -default ent6 -defaultid 8 The system displays the following message: ent10 available To create a shared Ethernet adapter in failover configuration with the control channel adapter ent5, create the shared Ethernet adapter as shown in example 4, but specify additional attributes ha_mode and ctl_chan with -attr.

 prepdev command Purpose Prepares a device to be assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).   Syntax prepdev { -dev devicename }   Description The prepdev command prepares a device to be assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition). This command determines whether the device specified by the -dev flag is already assigned or used in the following manner:Assigned to a shared memory pool (being used as a paging device) Used as a backup device for virtual SCSI Used by a file system, logical volume, or volume group. If the device is already being used or assigned to a shared memory pool, you receive system output that tells you how to prepare the device to be used as a paging space device.   Flags Flag name Description -dev devicename Specifies the logical device to be used as a paging space device.  --help Displays the help text for this command and exit.    Exit Status See .

 rmdev command Purpose Removes a device from the system.   Syntax rmdev {  |  } Name  [  ] [  ] [  ]   Description The rmdev command unconfigures and undefines the device specified with the device logical name. If you specify the -recursive flag, the rmdev command acts on any children of the device as well. By specifying the -ucfg flag the device will be unconfigured but not undefined.  Use the -pdev flag along with the parent device's logical name to delete all of the children devices. The children are deleted in the same recursive fashion as described above for the -recursive flag. The only difference is that the specified device itself is not deleted. Thus, the -recursive flag is redundant and need not be specified with the -pdev flag.   To protect the Configuration database, the rmdev command cannot be interrupted. Stopping this command before execution is complete could result in a corrupted database.   The device specified or the children of the device specified cannot be a physical or logical volume that is assigned to a shared memory pool (to be used as a paging space device by a shared memory partition).  You cannot remove the interface or inet0 that is used for the shared storage pool communication.   Flags Flag name Description -dev Name Specifies the logical device, indicated by the Name parameter. This flag may not be used with the -pdev flag. -pdev Name Specifies the parent logical device (indicated by the Name parameter whose children need to be removed. This flag may not be used with the -dev flag. -recursive Unconfigures the device and its children. -ucfg Unconfigures, but does not undefine the specified device. The device's state will be moved from Available to Defined. To move the device back to Available state run cfgdev -dev Name command. -f Forcefully removes or unconfigures the device even if it is in use.  This option can be used only with the physical volumes in cluster environment, where the device is not used in the active cluster of the system.   Exit Status See .   Examples To unconfigure the cd0 CD-ROM device, type the command as follows: rmdev  -dev cd0   To unconfigure the SCSI adapter scsi1 and all of its children, type the command as follows:  rmdev  -recursive -dev scsi1   To unconfigure just the children of the SCSI adapter scsi1, but not the adapter itself, type the command as follows: rmdev  -pdev scsi1    To unconfigure the children of PCI bus pci1 and all other devices under them, type the command as follows: rmdev  -pdev pci1    To remove the suspended virtual adapter and all the children, type the command as follows:rmdev -dev susadpt0 -recursive The system displays the following output:vtscsi0            deleted client_rootvg      deleted susadpt0           deleted  If you attempt to remove the interface that is used for cluster communication by typing the command as follows:rmdev -dev en0 The system displays the following error message with return code 78:The requested operation is not allowed because partition is a member of "test_cluster" cluster.

 rmpath command Purpose Removes from the system a path to an MPIO-capable device.   Syntax rmpath  { [  Name ] [  Parent ] [  Connection ] } [  ]   Description The rmpath command unconfigures, and possibly undefines, one or more paths associated with the specified target device (-dev Name). The set of paths that is removed is determined by the combination of the -dev Name, -pdev Parent and -conn Connection flags. If the command will result in all paths associated with the device being unconfigured or undefined, the command will exit with an error and without unconfiguring or undefining any path. In this situation, rmdev command must be used instead to unconfigure or undefine the target device itself.  The default action unconfigures each specified path, but does not completely remove it from the system. If the -rm flag is specified, the rmpath command unconfigures (if necessary) and removes, or deletes, the path definition(s) from the system.  When the rmpath command finishes, it displays a status message. When unconfiguring paths, it is possible for this command to be able to unconfigure some paths and not others (for example, paths that are in the process of doing I/O cannot be unconfigured).  The rmpath command provides status messages about the results of operation. Messages in one of the following formats will be generated: path [ defined | deleted ]  This message is displayed when a single path was successfully unconfigured or undefined. If the path is successfully configured the message path available displays. If the path is not successfully configured and there is no explicit error code returned by the method, the message path defined displays.  paths [defined | deleted]  This message is displayed if multiple paths were identified and all paths were successfully unconfigured or undefined. If the -rm flag is not specified, the message would be paths defined. If the -rm flag is specified, the message would be paths deleted.  some paths [ defined | deleted ]  This message is display if multiple paths were identified, but only some of them were successfully unconfigured or undefined. If the -rm flag is not specified, the message would be some paths defined. If the -rm flag is specified, the message would be some paths deleted. no paths processed  This message is generated if no paths were found matching the selection criteria.    Flags Flag name Description -rm  Indicates that the specified paths are to be deleted from the system. -dev Name  Specifies the logical device name of the target device whose path is to be removed. The paths to be removed are qualified via the -pdev and -conn flags. -pdev Parent Indicates the logical device name of the parent device to use in qualifying the paths to be removed. Since all paths to a device cannot be removed by this command, either this flag, the -conn flag, or both must be specified. -conn Connection Indicates the connection information to use in qualifying the paths to be removed. Since all paths to a device cannot be removed by this command, either this flag, the -pdev flag, or both must be specified.   Exit Status See .   Examples 1.

 rmvdev command Purpose To remove the connection between a physical device and its associated virtual SCSI adapter.   Syntax rmvdev [  ] {  TargetDevice  |  VirtualTargetDevice }  [] To remove a shared Ethernet adapter: rmvdev { SEAdevice} [ ] To remove a Link Aggregation adapter: rmvdev { LnaggDevice} [  [ TargetInterface]]   Description The rmvdev command removes the connection between a physical device and its associated virtual SCSI adapter. The connection can be identified by specifying the backing (physical) device or the virtual target device. If  the connection is specified by the device name and there are multiple connections between the physical device and virtual SCSI adapters and error is returned unless the -f flag is also specified.  If -f is included then all connections associated with the physical device are removed.    If the backing (physical) device is a logical volume and the -rmlv flag is specified, then logical volume will be removed as well.   Flags Flag name Description -f Forces the removal of all virtual target devices associated with the given backing device. -vdev TargetDevice Specifies the physical backing device -rmlv Deletes the backing device. This flag is valid only for logical volume backing devices. -vtd VirtualTargetDevice Specifies the virtual target device to remove. -sea SEAdevice Removes the Shared Ethernet Adapter -auto Migrates and removes the shared Ethernet adapter when used with the -migrate option. -migrate Migrates the settings from the physical adapter interface to the shared Ethernet adapter interface. -lnagg LnaggDevice Removes a Link Aggregation device. -interface TargetInterface Deleted the interfaces configured on the system for the target interface.   Exit Status See .

 save_base command Purpose Saves information about base-customized devices in the Device Configuration database for the boot device.   Syntax save_base [ Directory][ File][]   Description The save_base command stores customized information for base devices to use during phase 1 of system boot. By default, the save_base command retrieves this information from the /etc/objrepos directory. However, you can override this action by using the -o flag to specify an ODM directory. The save_base command is typically run without any parameters. It uses the /dev/ipl_blv special file link to identify the output destination.  Alternatively, use the -d flag to specify a destination file or a device, such as the /dev/hdisk0 device file. To identify a specific output destination, the -d flag identifies the file to which save_base writes the base customized device data. This file can be either a regular file or a device special file. The device special file identifies either a disk device special file or a boot logical volume device special file.  A disk device special file can be used where there is only one boot logical volume on the disk. The save_base command ensures that the given disk has only one boot logical volume present. If neither of these conditions is true, save_base does not save the base customized device data to the disk and exits with an error.    When a second boot logical volume is on a disk, the boot logical volume device special file must be used as the destination device to identify which boot image the base customized device data will be stored in. A boot logical volume device special file can be used even if there is only one boot logical volume on the disk. The save_base command ensures that the given device special file is a boot logical volume and it is bootable before saving any data to it. If either of these checks fails, save_base exits with an error.  The save_base command determines what device information to save using the PdDv.base field corresponding to each entry in the CuDv object class. Specifically, the PdDv.base field is a bit mask which represents the type of boot for which this device is a base device. The save_base command determines the current type of boot by accessing the boot_mask attribute in the CuAt object class. The value of this attribute is the bit mask to apply to the PdDv.base field to determine which devices are base.    Base devices are those devices that get configured during phase 1 boot; they may vary depending on the type of boot (mask). For example, if the mask is NETWORK_BOOT, network devices are considered base; for DISK_BOOT, disk devices are considered base. The type of boot masks are defined in the /usr/include/sys/cfgdb.h file.  The -m flag is no longer used by the save_base command. For compatibility reasons, the flag can be specified, but is not used.   Flags Flag name Description -path Directory  Specifies a directory containing the Device Configuration database.  By default, the save_base command retrieves this information from the /etc/objrepos directory. -file file Specifies the destination file or device to which the base information will be written. -verbose Specifies that verbose output is to be written to standard output (STDIN).   Exit Status See .   Examples  To save the base customized information and see verbose output, type the following command: save_base -verbose To specify an ODM directory other than the /usr/lib/objrepos directory, type the following command: save_base -o /tmp/objrepos To save the base customized information to the /dev/hdisk0 device file instead of to the boot disk, type the following command: save_base -d /dev/hdisk0     Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 snmpv3_ssw command Purpose Switch the symbolic links among the non-encrypted snmpdv3 agent, encrypted snmpdv3 agent and snmpdv1 agent.

 bootlist command Purpose Displays and alters the list of boot devices available to the system.   Syntax bootlist -mode mode {[  -ls  ] [ [ -rm ]  | [  Device [ -attr Attribute=Value ... ] ... ] ] }   Description The bootlist command allows the user to display and alter the list of possible boot devices from which the system may be booted. When the system is booted, it will scan the devices in the list and attempt to boot from the first device it finds containing a boot image. This command supports the updating of the following:  Service boot list. The service list designates possible boot devices for when the system is booted in service mode. How a system is booted in service mode is hardware-platform dependent. It may require a key switch to be turned to the Service position, a particular function key to be pressed during the boot process, or some other mechanism, as defined for the particular hardware platform. Previous boot device entry. This entry designates the last device from which the system booted. Some hardware platforms may attempt to boot from the previous boot device before looking for a boot device in one of the other lists.  The bootlist command supports the specification of generic device types as well as specific devices for boot candidates.  Devices in the boot device list occur in the same order as devices listed on the invocation of this command.  The selection of the boot list to display or alter is made with the -mode mode option, where the mode variable is one of the keywords: service, normal, both, or prevboot. If the both keyword is specified, then both the normal boot list and the service boot list will be displayed, or if being altered, will be set to the same list of devices. If the prevboot keyword is specified, the only alteration allowed is with the -rm flag . The -rm flag invalidates the boot list specified by the -mode flag.  The devices currently in the boot list may be displayed by using the -ls flag. The list of devices that make up the specified boot list will be displayed, one device per line. If a device specified in the boot list is no longer present on the system, a '-' is displayed instead of a name.   When you add a hot plug adapter to the system, that adapter and its child devices might not be available for specification as a boot device when you use the bootlist command. You may be required to reboot your system to make all potential boot devices known to the operating system.   Device Choices 	The device name specified on the command line can occur in one of two different 	forms:   	It can indicate a specific device by its device logical name. It can indicate a generic or special device type by keyword. The following generic device keywords are supported:   	Keywords Description fd   Any standard I/O-attached diskette drive scdisk   Any SCSI-attached disk (including serial-link disk drives) badisk   Any direct bus-attached disk cd   Any SCSI-attached CD-ROM rmt   Any SCSI-attached tape device  ent   Any Ethernet adapter fddi   Any Fiber Distributed Data Interface adapter  	When a specific device is to be included in the device list, the 	device's logical name (used with system management commands) must be specified. 	This logical name is made up of a prefix and a suffix. The suffix is generally 	a number and designates the specific device. The specified device must be 	in the Available state. If it is not, the update to the device list is rejected and this command fails. The following devices and their associated logical 	names are supported (where the bold type is the prefix and the xx variable is the device-specific suffix):    	Device name Description fdxx    Diskette-drive device logical names hdiskxx    Physical-volume device logical names cdxx    SCSI CD-ROM device logical names rmtxx    Magnetic-tape device logical names entxx   Ethernet-adapter logical names fddixx   Fiber Distributed Data Interface adapter logical names  	 Attribute Choices 	Attributes are extra pieces of information about a device that the user 	supplies on the command line. Since this information is specific to a particular 	device, generic devices do not have attributes. Attributes apply to the device 	that immediately precedes them on the command line, which allows attributes 	to be interspersed among devices on the command line. Currently, only network 	devices have attributes. These are:  	Attribute Description bserver IP address of the BOOTP server gateway IP address of the gateway client IP address of the client speed Network adapter speed duplex The mode of the network adapter  	 Error Handling 	If this command returns with an error, the device lists are not altered. 	The following device list errors are possible:  	If the user attempts to display or alter a boot list that is not supported 	by the hardware platform, the command fails, indicating the mode is not supported. If the user attempts to add too many devices to the boot list, the command 	fails, indicating that too many devices were requested. The number of devices 	supported varies depending on the device selection and the hardware platform 	. If an invalid keyword, invalid flag, or unknown device is specified, the 	command fails with the appropriate error message.  If a specified device is not in the Available state, the command 	fails with the appropriate error message.   	 Flags  Flag name Description Device Provides the names of the specific or generic devices to include in the boot list. -attr Attribute=Value Specifies the device attribute value pairs to be used instead of the defaults. The Attribute=Value variable can be used to specify one attribute value pair or multiple attribute value pairs for one -attr flag. If you use an -attr flag with multiple attribute value pairs, the list of pairs must be enclosed in quotation marks with a blank space between the pairs. For example, entering -attr Attribute=Value lists one attribute value pair per flag, while entering -attr 'Attribute1=Value1 Attribute2=Value2' lists more than one attribute value pair. -mode Mode Specifies which boot list to  display or  alter. Possible values for the mode variable are normal, service, both, or prevboot. -ls Indicates that the specified boot list is to be displayed after any specified alteration is performed. The output is a list of device names. -rm Indicates that the device list specified by the -mode flag should be invalidated.   Exit Status See .   Examples To invalidate the Service mode boot list, type:   bootlist -mode service -rm To make a boot list for Normal mode with devices listed on the command line, type:   bootlist -mode normal hdisk0 hdisk1 rmt0 fd To attempt to boot through a gateway using Ethernet, and then try other devices, type a command similar to the following. Substitute the IP addresses specified in the example with your IP addresses.   bootlist -mode normal ent0 -attr gateway=129.35.21.1 bserver=129.12.2.10 \ client=129.35.9.23 hdisk0 rmt0 tok0 bserver=129.35.10.19 hdisk1   Related Information The  command.

 backup command To back up a file system by i-node, specify the -Level and FileSystem parameters. When used in conjunction with the -u  flag, the -Level parameter provides a method of maintaining a hierarchy of incremental backups for each file system. Specify the -u flag and set the -Level parameter to n to back up only those files that have been modified since the n-1 level back up.  The possible back up levels are 0 to 9. A level 0 back up archives all files in the file system. The FileSystem parameter can specify either the physical device name (block or raw name) or the name of the directory on which the file system is mounted. The default file system is the root (/) file system.  Users must have read access to the file system device (such as /dev/hd4) or have back up authorization to perform backups by i_node.  You must first unmount a file system before backing it up by i-node. If you attempt to back up a mounted file system, a warning message is displayed. The backup command continues, but the created back up might contain inconsistencies because of changes that might have occurred in the file system during the back up operation.  Backing up file systems by i-node truncates the uid or gid of files having a uid or gid greater than 65535. When restored, these files might have different values for the uid and gid attributes. To retain the values correctly, always back up by name those files that have a uid or gid greater than 65535.  You can archive only JFS (Journaled File System) file systems when backing up by i-node. Back up any non-JFS file systems by file name.   Purpose Backs up files and file systems.   Syntax To back up files by name:  backup  [  Number ] [  [  RegularExpression ] ] [ {force|ignore|warn} ] [ Device ] [  Number ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ]  To back up file systems by i-node:  backup [ [  ] [  Number ] [ ] [ Device ] [  Length ] [  ] [  ] ] [ FileSystem ] | [  |  ] [  ]   Description The backup command creates copies of your files on a back up medium, such as a magnetic tape or diskette. The copies are in one of the two back up formats:  Specific files backed up by name using the -i flag. Entire file system backed up by i-node using the Level and FileSystem parameters.  If you issue the backup command without any parameters, the root file system level 9 i-node back ups to the /dev/rfd0 device. The default syntax is: -9uf/dev/rfd0 /dev/rhd4  The default back up device is /dev/rfd0. If flags are specified that are not appropriate for the specified back up device, the backup command displays an error message and continues with the back up. A single back up can span multiple volumes.  Running the backup command results in the loss of all material previously stored on the selected output medium. Data integrity of the archive might be compromised if a file is modified during system back up. Keep system activity at a minimum during the system back up procedure. If a back up is made to a tape device with the device block size set to 0, it might be difficult to restore data from the tape unless the default write size was used with the backup command. The default write size for the backup command can be read by the restore command when the tape device block size is 0.  In other words, the -b flag should not be specified when the tape device block size is 0. If the -b flag of the backup command is specified and is different from the default size, the same size must be specified with the -b flag of the restore command when the archived files are restored from the tape.    Backing up files by name To back up by name, use the -i flag. The backup command reads standard input for the names of the files to be backed up.  File types can be special files, regular files, or directories. When the file type is a directory, only the directory is backed up. The files under the directory are not backed up, unless they are explicitly specified.  Files are restored using the same path names as the archived files. Therefore, to create a back up that can be restored from any path, use full path names for the files that you want to back up.  When backing up files that require multiple volumes, do not enter the list of file names from the keyboard. Instead, pipe or redirect the list from a file to the backup command.   When you enter the file names from the keyboard and the back up process needs a new tape or diskette, the command loses any file names already entered but not yet backed up. To avoid this problem, enter each file name only after the archived message for the previous file has been displayed. The archived message consists of the character a followed by the file name.  If you specify the -p flag, only files of less than 2 GB are packed.    Backing up file systems by i-node To back up a file system by i-node, specify the -Level and FileSystem parameters. When used in conjunction with the -u flag, the -Level parameter provides a method of maintaining a hierarchy of incremental backups for each file system. Specify the -u flag and set the -Level parameter to n to back up only those files that have been modified since the n-1 level backup. Information regarding the date, time, and level of each incremental backup is written to the /etc/dumpdates file. The possible backup levels are 0 to 9. A level 0 backup archives all files in the file system. If the /etc/dumpdates file contains no backup information for a particular file system, specifying any level causes all files in that file system to be archived.   The FileSystem parameter can specify either the physical device name (block or raw name) or the name of the directory on which the file system is mounted. The default file system is the root (/) file system. Users must have read access to the file system device (such as /dev/hd4) or have Backup authorization in order to perform backups by i_node. You must first unmount a file system before backing it up by i-node. If you attempt to back up a mounted file system, a warning message is displayed. The backup command continues, but the created backup may contain inconsistencies because of changes that may have occurred in the file system during the backup operation. Backing up file systems by i-node truncates the uid or gid of files having a uid or gid greater than 65535. When restored, these files may have different values for the uid and gid attributes. To retain the values correctly, always back up by name files having a uid or gid greater than 65535. You can archive only JFS (Journaled File System) file systems when backing up by i-node. Back up any non-JFS file systems by file name or by using other archive commands, such as the pax, tar, or cpio command  The -Z flag is mandatory for backing up encrypted file systems.   FlagsFlag name Description -b Number  For backups by name, specifies the number of 512-byte blocks; for backups by i-node, specifies the number of 1024-byte blocks to write in a single output operation. When the backup command writes to tape devices, the default is 100 for backups by name and 32 for backups by i-node.   The write size is the number of blocks multiplied by the block size. The default write size for the backup command writing to tape devices is 51200 (100 Ã 512) for backups by name and 32768 (32 Ã 1024) for backups by i-node. The write size must be an even multiple of the tape's physical block size.  The value of the -b flag is always ignored when the backup command writes to diskette.  -c Specifies that the tape is a cartridge, not a nine-track. -e RegularExpression Specifies that the files with names matching the regular expression are not to be packed. A regular expression is a set of characters, meta characters, and operators that define a string or group of strings in a search pattern. It can also be a string containing wildcard characters and operations that define a set of one or more possible strings. The -e flag is applied only when the -p flag is specified. -ejt Rewinds the tape and takes the tape drive offline. This will unload the tape when appropriate. The tape must be re-inserted before the device can be used again. -E For backups by name, the -E flag requires one of the following arguments. If you omit the -E option, warn is the default behavior.  force Fails the back up operation on a file if the fixed extent size or space reservation of the file cannot be preserved. ignore Ignores any errors in preserving extent attributes. warn Issues a warning if the space reservation or the fixed extent size of the file cannot be preserved.  -f Device  Specifies the output device. To send output to a named device, specify the Device variable as a path name such as the following example: /dev/rmt0 To send output to the standard output device, specify a - (minus sign). The - (minus sign) feature enables you to pipe the output of the backup command to the dd command.  You can also specify a range of archive devices. The range specification must be in the following format: /dev/deviceXXX-YYY where XXX and YYY are whole numbers, and XXX must always be less than YYY; for example:  /dev/rfd0-3  All devices in the specified range must be of the same type. For example, you can use a set of 8 mm, 2.3 GB tapes or a set of 1.44 MB diskettes. All tape devices must be set to the same physical tape block size.  If the Device variable specifies a range, the backup command automatically goes from one device in the range to the next. After exhausting all of the specified devices, the backup command stops and requests that new volumes be mounted on the range of devices. F Â  G Â  i Specifies that files be read from standard input and archived by file name. If relative path names are used, files are restored (with the restore command) relative to the current directory at restore time. If full path names are used, files are restored to those same names. -L Length Specifies the length of the tape in bytes. This flag overrides the -c, -d, and -s flags. You can specify the size with a suffix of b, k, m, or g to represent blocks (512 bytes), kilo (1024 bytes), mega (1024 KB), or giga (1024 MB), respectively. To represent a tape length of 2 GB, enter -L 2g.    Use the -L flag only for i-node backups. -Level Specifies the backup level (0 to 9). The default level is 9. -l Number Limits the total number of blocks to use on the diskette device. The value specified must be a nonzero multiple of the number of sectors per diskette track. This option applies to by-name backups only.  -o Creates a Version 2-compatible back up by name. This flag is required for compatibility with Version 2 systems because backups by name that are created by a version higher than 2 cannot be restored on Version 2 systems. To create a Version 2-compatible back up by name, use the -o flag along with other flags required for backups by name.Files with attributes and values, such as user IDs and group IDs, that are too large for Version 2 systems are not backed up. A message is displayed for each such file and each value that is too large. -p Specifies that the files be packed, or compressed, before they are archived. Only files smaller than 2 GB are packed.    This option should only be used when backing up files from an inactive file system. Modifying a file when a back up is in progress might result in corruption of the back up and an inability to recover the data. When backing up to a tape device that performs compression, this option can be omitted. -q Indicates that the removable medium is ready to use. When you specify the -q flag, the backup command proceeds without prompting you to prepare the back up medium. Press the Enter key to continue. This option applies only to the first volume. You are prompted for subsequent volumes. The -q flag applies only to backups by name. -U Specifies to back up any access control list (ACL)s or named extended attributes. Without this option the image will include only   and Printing Color Files (PCLs) in the archive along with the other regular file data.  -u Updates the /etc/dumpdates file with the raw device name of the file system and the time, date, and level of the back up. You must specify the -u flag if you are making incremental backups. The -u flag applies only to backups by i-node. -v Causes the backup command to display additional information about the back up. When using the -v flag, the size of the file as it exists on the archive is displayed in bytes. Additionally, a total of these file sizes is displayed when all files have been processed. Directories are listed with a size of 0. Symbolic links are listed with the size of the symbolic link. Hard links are listed with the size of the file, which is how hard links are archived. Block and character devices, if they were backed up, are listed with a size of 0.  When the -v flag is not specified, the backup command displays only the names of the files being archived. This option is used only when backing up by file name. -w Disabled. If the -w flag is specified, no other flags are applied. -W Displays, for each file system in the /etc/dumpdates file, the most recent back up date and level. If the -W flag is specified, no other flags are applied.   Exit Status This command returns the following exit values:  Return code Description 0   Successful completion. >0   An error occurred.   Examples To back up all the files and subdirectories in the /home directory using full path names, type the following command:  find /home -print | backup  -i -f /dev/rmt0  The -i flag specifies that files will be read from standard input and archived by the file name. The find command generates a list of all the files in the /home directory. The files in this list are full path names. The | (pipe symbol) causes this list to be read from standard input by the backup command. The -f flag directs the backup command to write the files to the /dev/rmt0 tape device. Because the files are archived using full path names, they will be written to the same paths when restored. To back up all the files and subdirectories in the /home/padmin directory using relative path names, type the following command:  find . -print | backup  -i -v -q  Each file name in the list generated by the find command is preceded by ./ (dot, slash). Because the files are backed up using relative path names, they are written to the current directory when restored. The -v flag causes the backup command to display additional information about the backup. The files are written to the default backup device /dev/rfd0. To back up the / (root) file system, type the following command:  backup  -0 -u -f /dev/rmt0 /  The 0 level specifies that all the files in the / (root) file system be backed up. The -u flag causes the backup command to update the /etc/dumpdates  file for this backup. To back up all the files in the root (/) file system that have been modified since the last level 0 backup, type the following command:  backup  -1 -u -f /dev/rmt0 /  If the /etc/dumpdates file does not have an entry for a level 0 backup of the / (root) system, all the files in the file system are backed up. To back up virtual optical media files from the virtual media repository, complete the following tasks: Create a file called backup_files with the names of the files to be backed up.  Include the full path name. /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_file1 /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_file2 /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_filen Send the file using the backup command: cat backup_files | backup -i -f /dev/rmt0   Related Information The  command.

 backupios command Purpose Creates an installable image of the root volume group either onto a bootable tape, file system, or DVD.   Syntax backupios   {Directory} [] []  backupios   {File name} [] [ ] [] []  backupios   Device [] [ ] [] [] []  backupios   Device   { | } [] [] []   Description The backupios command creates a backup of the  and places it onto a file system, bootable tape, or DVD. You can use this backup to reinstall a system to its original state after it has been corrupted. If you create the backup on tape , the tape is bootable and includes the installation programs needed to install from the backup.   If the -cd flag is specified, the backupios command creates a system backup image to DVD-RAM media. If you need to create multi-volume discs because the image does not fit on one disc, the backupios command gives instructions for disk replacement and removal until all the volumes have been created.    Vendor disc drives may support burning to additional disc types, such as CD-RW and DVD-R. Refer to the documentation for your drive to determine which disc types are supported.  If the -file flag is specified, the backupios command creates a system backup image to the path specified. The file system must be mounted and writable by the  root user prior to running the backupios command (see  for details). Backing up the  to a remote file system will create the nim_resources.tar image in the directory you specify. The  must have root write access to the server on which the backup will be created. This backup can be reinstalled from the  using the installios command.  The backupios command empties the target_disks_stanza section of bosinst.data (which is part of the nim_resources.tar image) and sets RECOVER_DEVICES=Default. This allows the mksysb file generated by the command to be cloned to another logical partition.  If you plan to use the nim_resources.tar image to install to a specific disk, then you need to repopulate the target_disks_stanza section of bosinst.data and replace this file in the nim_resources.tar image. All other parts of the nim_resources.tar image must remain unchanged.  Prior to backing up the root volume group, the backupios command saves the structure of all user-defined volume groups by calling the savevgstruct command for each volume group defined. To avoid having all user-defined volume groups backed up, use the -nosvg flag.   The backupios command backs up only the volume group structures that are activated. The structures of volumes groups that are deactivated are not backed up.   Flags Flag name Description -accept Accepts licenses. -blocks Number Specifies the number of 512-byte blocks to write in a single output operation. Default is 100. Should be used with tape device only. -cd Specifies the cd device name on which the image is to be stored. -cdformat Creates final CD images that are DVD sized (up to 4.38 GB).  -file Specifies the directory on which the image is to be stored. Enter the complete directory pathname. Images are reinstalled using NIMOL. Note: When the -mksysb flag is used, the NIMOL resources are not saved in the image. With -mksysb option, specify filename. When the -mksysb flag is used, the NIMOL resources are not saved in the image. With -mksysb option, specify filename. -mksysb Creates an image without the NIMOL resources. -nomedialib  Prevents the contents of the media repository from being saved as part of the backupios process. -nopak When used with the -tape flag, the -nopak flag disables software packing of the files as they are backed up. Some tape drives use their own packing or compression algorithms. When used with the -file flag, the -nopak flag excludes files that are listed line by line in the /etc/exclude_packing.rootvg file from being packed. -nosvg Prevents the volume groups structure of user defined volume groups from being saved as part  of the backupios process. -tape Specifies the tape device name on which the image is to be stored. -udf Creates a UDF (Universal Disk Format) file system on DVD-RAM media. The default format is Rock Ridge (ISO9660). -verify Verifies a tape backup. This flag causes the  command to verify the file header of each file on the backup tape and report any read errors as they occur.   Exit Status See .   ExamplesTo generate a backup to the optical device named /dev/cd1, type: backupios -cd /dev/cd1 -cdformat To generate a system backup to a tape device named /dev/rmt0, type: backupios -tape /dev/rmt0   Related Information The  command and the  command.

 chdate command Purpose Displays or changes the date, time or time zone.   Syntax  [ mmddHHMM [YYyy | yy] ] [ TZ]     [ YYyy] [ mm] [ dd] [ HH] [ MM] [ TZ]    Description Displays or changes the system date, time, or time zone. Changes made to the time zone will not take effect until the user logs out. For the time zone to take effect for the entire system, the system must be rebooted. All flags are optional, and the current system time information will be used if a flag was unspecified.    If no flags or arguments are specified, the  command displays the current date and time.    The mmddHHMM [YYyy | yy]	parameters correspond to month, day, hour, minute, and optional 4 or 2 digit year.  If you do not specify the first 2 digits of the year, values in the range 70 - 99 refer to the twentieth century and values in the range 00 - 37 refer to the twenty-first century. If a 4-digit year is specified, the  command attempts to set the year to YYyy and fails for the values that are out of range (less than 1970 and greater than 2105). For years in the range 2038 - 2105, specify the year in the yyyy format.   The user must have padmin authority to change the date and time.   Flags Flag name Description -year Sets the year to YYyy. -month Sets the month to mm. -day Sets the day to dd. -hour Sets the hour to HH in 24-hour format. -minute Sets the minute to MM. -timezone Sets the time zone (for example, CST6CDT).

 fsck command Purpose Checks file system consistency and interactively repairs the file system.   Syntax fsck [ FileSystem ... ]   Description The fsck command checks and interactively repairs inconsistent file systems. Normally, the file system is consistent, and the fsck command merely reports on the number of files, used blocks, and free blocks in the file system. If the file system is inconsistent, the fsck command displays information about the inconsistencies found and prompts you for permission to repair them. If no FileSystem is specified, all file systems are checked.  The fsck command checks for the following inconsistencies: Blocks or fragments allocated to multiple files. inodes containing block or fragment numbers that overlap. inodes containing block or fragment numbers out of range. Discrepancies between the number of directory references to a file and the link count of the file. Illegally allocated blocks or fragments. inodes containing block or fragment numbers that are marked free in the disk map. inodes containing corrupt block or fragment numbers. A fragment that is not the last disk address in an inode. This check does not apply to compressed file systems. Files larger than 32KB containing a fragment. This check does not apply to compressed file systems. Size checks: Incorrect number of blocks. Directory size not a multiple of 512 bytes.   These checks do not apply to compressed file systems. Directory checks: Directory entry containing an inode number marked free in the inode map. inode number out of range. Dot (.) link missing or not pointing to itself. Dot dot (..) link missing or not pointing to the parent directory. Files that are not referenced or directories that are not reachable. Inconsistent disk map. Inconsistent inode map.  In addition to its messages, the fsck command records the outcome of its checks and repairs through its exit value. This exit value can be any sum of the following conditions: Value Description 0 All checked file systems are now okay. 2 The fsck command was interrupted before it could complete checks or repairs. 4 The fsck command changed the file system; the user must restart the system immediately. 8 The file system contains unrepaired damage.   Exit Status See .   Examples To check a file system, enter: fsck /dev/hd1 This command checks the unmounted file system located on the /dev/hd1 device.   Parent topic:  Parent topic:

 ldfware command Purpose Loads the system's flash EPROM with the specified file, which must contain a valid binary flash EPROM image, and then reboots the system.   Syntax ldfware [  Device ]  filename  ldfware  ldfware    Description Periodically, you need to install fixes for your server firmware. If  you do not use an  to manage your server, you must get your fixes through your operating system. If your server is not connected to the Internet, you must obtain optical media that contains the server firmware fix and install the server firmware fix from the optical media.  The flash update image file is copied to the file system from diskette. The user needs to provide the image on a diskette if the user does not have access to remote file systems or any other files that are on the system. If enough space is not available, an error is reported stating additional system memory is needed. After the file is copied, a warning screen asks for confirmation to continue the update flash. Continuing the update flash reboots the system. The current flash image is not saved.  After you download and install a firmware fix, the fix is temporarily installed until you install it permanently. You might want to use the new level of firmware for a period of time to verify that it works correctly. When you are sure that the new level of firmware works correctly, you can permanently install the firmware fix. Be aware that if you install the firmware fix permanently (copy the temporary firmware level from the temporary side to the permanent side, so that the temporary and permanent sides contain the same level of firmware), you cannot return to the level that was previously on the permanent side. To install it permanently, use the -commit flag.   The ldfware command reboots the entire system. Do not use this command if more than one user is signed onto the system.   Flags Flag name Description -commit Commits the temporary image when booted from the temporary image. This effectively causes the permanent image to be copied over by the temporary image. This flag is not supported on all systems. -dev Device Specifies that the flash update image file is on diskette. The device_name variable specifies the device. The default device_name is /dev/fd0. -file FileName Specifies the file name of the image file source. The flash update image file source follows this flag. The file_name variable specifies the fully qualified path of the flash update image file. -reject Rejects the temporary image when booted from the permanent image.  This overwrites the temporary image with the permanent image. This flag is not supported on all systems.   Exit Status The following exit codes are returned:  Value Description 0 Completed successfully. 1 Command terminated due to an error.      2 Command was aborted by the user. 3 Command was aborted by the user using the F10 key.   Examples To update the firmware from a local file, type the following command:     ldfware -file /tmp/firmware/latest_flash    To update the firmware that is on a diskette, type the following command:                ldfware -device /dev/fd0 -file latest_flash  To update the firmware that is on a CD device, type the following command: mount -cd  /mnt ldfware -file /mnt/firmware/latest_flash   Parent topic:  Parent topic:

 lsfware command Purpose Displays microcode and firmware levels of the system, adapters and devices.   Syntax lsfware [  |  Name ]   Description The lsfware command displays the platform system firmware microcode level and the service processor microcode levels, if supported. Not all systems contain a service processor, nor do all systems support displaying the system processor level. Information on a specific device is displayed with the -dev flag.   The -all flag displays system firmware/microcode for all devices.  The output from the -all flag is always delimiter separated.     Flags Flag name Description -all Displays microcode level information for all supported devices. -dev Name Displays microcode level information for the named device.   Examples To display the system firmware level and service processor (if present), type:   lsfware The system displays the following message: System Firmware level is TCP99256  To display the microcode level for all supported devices, type:  lsfware -all The system displays the following message: sys0|system:TCP99256  rmt0|C009  scraid0|adapter:4.20.18|adapter-boot:4.00.26  raid-dasd|22:FFC #:DDYS-T0.524D3031.53393446  raid-dasd|26:FFC #:DDYS-T0.524D3031.53393446  raid-dasd|2e:FFC #:DDYS-T0.525A3034.53393243  ....

Examples 	To display the logical partition number and name, type: 	lslparinfo  	 Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 motd command Purpose Displays or modifies the partition's message of the day file.   Syntax motd  [ |  ]  Filename  motd  [ |  ]  "Message of the day string"   Description The motd command writes or appends to the partitions message of the day file.  The new message can be specified on the command line or in a file with the -file flag.  If no flags are specified the current message of the day is displayed.   Flags Flag name Description -append Appends the specified message to the current message of the day -file FileName Replaces the current message of the day with the contents of FileName -overwrite Replaces the current message of the day with the specified message   Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 pdump command Purpose Perform platform (hardware and firmware) dump-related actions.   Syntax pdump { fstype  |  |  |  | }   Description The pdump command helps the operating system save firmware and hardware related dumps. This command also provides an estimate of the disk space required for storing these dumps. Note that platform and scan dumps are saved in order to capture the state of the firmware and the hardware for analysis.   Flags Flag name Description -disable Disables platform dumps. -enable Enables platform dumps. -ls Lists the current configuration of platform dump. -reserve fstype Reserves enough disk space on the system for platform dumps. The -enable option will create a file system (if one does not exist) exclusively for platform dumps. If a file system already exists and the size is not enough, the file system size will be increased. The fstype must be a valid file system type. If the file system already exists, any may be specified. -size Provides an estimate of disk space required to save the platform dumps when they occur. This option will interact with the firmware to provide this estimate. It is expected that, based on this space information, the user will have enough disk space allocated for platform dumps to be saved. The value output will be the required size in bytes.

 restore command Purpose Extracts files from archives created with the backup command.   Syntax To restore files archived by file name:  restore -x [ d M n Q v q e ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] [ -E { force | ignore | warn } ] [ File ... ]  To list files archived by file name:  restore -T | -t [a l n q v Q ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ]  To restore files archived by file system:  restore -r [ B n q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f  Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] restore -R [ B n v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] restore -i [ h m n q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] restore -x [ B h n m q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] [ File ... ]  To restore files beginning at a specified volume number:   restore -X Number [ -Md n q v e Q ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s Number ] [ -E { force | ignore | warn } ] [ File ... ]  To list files archived by file system:  restore -t | -T [ B a l n h q v y ] [ -b Number ] [ -f Device ] [ -s SeekBackup ] [ File ... ]  To restore file attributes archived by file name:  restore -Pstring [B d q v Q ] [ b Number] [ s SeekNumber ] [-f Device ] [ File ... ]  To restore file attributes archived by file system:  restore -Pstring [ h q v] [ b Number] [ s SeekNumber ] [-f Device] [ File ... ]   Description The restore command reads archives created by the backup operation and extracts the files stored on them. These archives can be in either file name or file system format. An archive can be stored on disk, diskette, or tape. Files must be restored using the same method by which they were archived. This requires that you know the format of the archive. The archive format can be determined by examining the archive volume header information that is displayed when using the -T flag. When using the -x, -r, -T, or -t flags, the restore command automatically determines the archive format.    The restore command determines the actively sparses files that are being restored. If a file has block aligned and sized areas that are NULL populated, then the restore command does not cause physical space for those file system blocks to be allocated. The size in bytes of the file remain the same, but the actual space taken within the file system is only for the non-NULL areas.  Individual files can be restored from either file name or file system archives by using the -x flag and specifying the file name. The file name must be specified as it exists on the archive. Files can be restored interactively from file system archives using the -i flag. The names of the files on an archive can be written to standard output using the -T flag.   Users must have write access to the file system device or have restore authorization in order to extract the contents of the archive.   The diskette device, /dev/rfd0, is the default media for the restore command. To restore from standard input, specify a dash (-) with the -f flag. You can also specify a range of devices, such as /dev/rmt0-2.    If you are restoring from a multiple-volume archive, the restore command reads the volume mounted, prompts you for the next volume, and waits for your response. After inserting the next volume, press the Enter key to continue restoring files.  If an archive was created using the backup command and was made to a tape device with the device block size set to 0, it might be necessary for you to have explicit knowledge of the block size that was used when the tape was created to restore from the tape.  Multiple archives can exist on a single tape. When you are restoring multiple archives from tape, the restore command expects the input device to be a no-retension-on-open, no-rewind-on-close tape device. Do not use a no-rewind tape device for restoring unless the -B, -s, or -X flag is specified.    File system archives  File system archives are also known as i-node archives due to the method used to archive the files. A file system name is specified with the backup command, and the files within that file system are archived based on their structure and layout within the file system. The restore command restores the files on a file system archive without any special understanding of the underlying structure of the file system.   When restoring file system archives, the restore command creates and uses a file named restoresymtable. This file is created in the current directory. The file is necessary for the restore command to do incremental file system restore operation.   Do not remove the restoresymtable file if you perform incremental file system backups and restores.  The File parameter is ignored when using either the -r or the -R flag.  File-name archives  File-name archives are created by specifying a list of file names to archive by using the backup command. The restore operation restores the files from a file name archive without any special understanding of the underlying structure of the file system. The restore operation allows for metacharacters to be used when specifying files for archive extraction. This provides the capability to extract files from an archive based on pattern matching. A pattern file name should be enclosed in single quotations, and patterns should be enclosed in parentheses (...).  About sparse files  File system files for the operating system that contain long strings of NULLs can be stored much more efficiently than other files. To be specific, if a string of NULLs spans an entire allocation block, that whole block is not stored on disk at all. Files where one or more blocks are omitted in this way are called sparse files. The missing blocks are also known as holes.   Sparse files are not the same as compressed files. Sparse files are exactly the same as their nonsparse equivalents when they are read.  Sparse files are generally created by database applications. Whenever a database file is created, it is formatted with NULLs. These fragments might be either filled with allocated or deallocated NULLs.   Flags Flag name Description -a Displays the -a option displays the list of files in the archive, along with their permissions when specified with the -t or -T flag. -B Specifies that the archive should be read from standard input. Normally, the restore operation examines the actual medium to determine the backup format. When using a |  (pipe), this examination cannot occur. As a result, the archive is assumed to be in file system format, and the device is assumed to be standard input (-f -). -b Number  For backups done by name, specifies the number of 512-byte blocks. For backups done by i-node, specifies the number of 1024-byte blocks to read in a single output operation. When the restore operation reads from tape devices, the default is 100 for backups by name and 32 for backups by i-node.   The read size is the number of blocks multiplied by the block size. The default read size for the restore operation reading from tape devices is 51200 (100 Ã 512) for backups by name and 32768 (32 Ã 1024) for backups by i-node. The read size must be an even multiple of the tape's physical block size. If the read size is not an even multiple of the tape's physical block size and it is in fixed block mode (nonzero), the restore command tries to determine a valid value for Number. If successful, the restore operation changes Number to the new value, writes a message about the change to standard output, and continues. If unsuccessful in finding a valid value for Number, the restore operation writes an error message to standard error and exits with a nonzero return code. Larger values for the Number parameter result in larger physical transfers from the tape device.   The value of the -b flag is always ignored when the restore command reads from diskette. In this case, the command always reads in clusters that occupy a complete track. -d Indicates that, if the File parameter is a directory, all files in that directory should be restored. This flag can only be used when the archive is in file name format. -e  Restores the nonsparse files because they were archived by the name format of the backup operation for both packed and unpacked files. It is necessary to know the sparseness or nonsparseness of the files before archiving the files, since enabling this flag restores the sparse files as nonsparse.    This flag should be enabled only if the files being restored are nonsparsed, consisting of more than 4K NULLs. If the -e flag is specified during the restore opeation, it successfully restores all normal files normally and nonsparse database files as nonsparse. -E  Extracts beginning at a specified volume number and requires one of the following arguments. If you omit the -E flag, warn is the default behavior.  force Fails the restore operation on a file if the fixed extent size or space reservation of the file cannot be preserved. ignore Ignores any errors in preserving extent attributes. warn Issues a warning if the space reservation or the fixed size of the file cannot be preserved.  -f Device  Specifies the input device. To receive input from a named device, specify the Device variable as a path name (such as /dev/rmt0). To receive input from the standard output device, specify a dash (-)   You can also specify a range of archive devices. The range specification must be in the following format:  /dev/deviceXXX-YYY where XXX and YYY are whole numbers, and XXX must always be less than YYY; for example:  /dev/rfd0-3  All devices in the specified range must be of the same type. For example, you can use a set of 8 mm, 2.3 GB tapes or a set of 1.44 MB diskettes. All tape devices must be set to the same physical tape block size.  If the Device  variable specifies a range, the restore operation automatically goes from one device in the range to the next. After exhausting all of the specified devices, the restore operation halts and requests that new volumes be mounted on the range of devices. -h Restores only the actual directory, not the files contained in it. This flag can only be used when the archive is in file system format. This flag is ignored when used with the -r or -R flag. -i Allows you to interactively restore selected files from a file system archive. The subcommands for the -i  flag are: add [File]: Specifies that the File parameter is added to the list of files to extract.  If File is a directory, that directory and all the  files contained in it are added to the extraction list (unless the -h flag is used). If File is not specified,  the current directory is added to the extraction list.  cd Directory:  Changes the current directory to the specified directory.  delete [File]:  Specifies that  the File parameter is to be removed from the list of  files to be extracted. If File is a directory, that directory  and all the files contained in it are removed from the extraction list (unless the  -h flag is used).  extract:  Restores all the directories and files on the extraction list.   help:  Displays a summary of the subcommands.    ls [Directory]:  Displays the directories and files contained within the Directory parameter. Directory names are displayed with a slash (/) after the name. Files and directories, within the specified directory, that are on the extraction list are displayed with an asterick (*) before the name. If verbose mode is on, the  i-node number of the files and directories is also displayed. If the Directory parameter is not specified, the current directory is used .  pwd:  Displays the full path name of the current directory.   quit:  Causes the restore operation to exit immediately. Any files on the extraction list are not restored.  setmodes:  Sets the owner, mode, and time for all directories added to the extraction list.  verbose:  Causes the ls subcommand to display the i-node number of files and directories.  Additional information about each file is also displayed as it is extracted from the archive.    -l Displays a detailed list of files, which includes the time stamp, file permissions, file size, owner, and group  when specified with the -t or -T flag.. The -l option overrides the -a option. -M Sets the access and modification times of restored files to the time of restoration. You can specify the -M flag only when you are restoring individually named files and only if the -x or -X flags are also specified. When the -M flag is not specified, the restore operation maintains the access and modification times as they appear on the backup medium. -m Renames restored files to the file's i-node number as it exists on the archive. This is useful if a few files are being restored and you want these files restored under a different file name. Since any restored archive members are renamed to their i-node numbers, directory hierarchies and links are not preserved. Directories and hard links are restored as regular files. The -m flag is used when the archive is in file system format. -n By default the restore operation restores any Access Control List (ACL)s, Printing Color Files (PCL)s, or named extended attributes in the archive. The -n flag causes the restore operation to skip over any ACLs, PCLs, or named extended attributes in the archive and not restore them. -Pstring Restore only the file attributes. This flag does not restore the file contents. If the file specified does not exist in the target directory path, the file is not created. This flag restores file attributes selectively depending on the flags specified in the string parameter. The String parameter can be a combination of the following characters:  A Restore all attributes.  a Restore only the permissions of the files. o Restore only the ownership of the files. t Restore only the time stamp of the files. c Restore only the ACL attributes of the files   Among the existing flags for the restore command, flags v, h, b, s, f, B, d, and q are valid with the P flag. The P flag can be used with both file name and file system archives. If the File parameter is a symbolic link, then the metadata of the target file is modified and not that of the symbolic link.   Usage of -P flag overwrites the attributes of files owned by another user when run by the superuser. -Q For backups done by name, specifies that the command should exit upon encountering any type of error rather than attempt to recover and continue processing the archive. -q Specifies that the first volume is ready to use and that the restore operation should not prompt you to mount the volume and press Enter. If the archive spans multiple volumes, the restore command prompts you for the subsequent volumes. -r Restores all files in a file system archive. The -r flag is only used to restore complete level 0 backups or to restore incremental backups after a level 0 backup is restored. The restoresymtable file is used by the restore operation to pass information between incremental restore operations. This file should be removed after the last incremental backup is restored. The File parameter is ignored when using the -r flag. -R Requests a specific volume of a multiple-volume, file system archive. The -R flag allows a previously interrupted restore operation to be restarted. The File parameter is ignored when using the -R flag. Once restarted, the restore command behavior is the same as with the -r flag. -s SeekBackup Specifies the backup to seek and restore on a multiple-backup tape archive. The -s flag is only applicable when the archive is written to a tape device. To use the -s flag properly, a no-rewind-on-close and no-retension-on-open tape device, such as /dev/rmt0.1 or /dev/rmt0.5, must be specified. If the -s flag is specified with a rewind tape device, the restore command displays an error message and exits with a nonzero return code. If a no-rewind tape device is used and the -s flag is not specified, a default value of -s 1 is used. The value of the SeekBackup parameter must be in the range of 1 to 100 inclusive. It is necessary to use a no-rewind-on-close, no-retension-on-open tape device because of the behavior of the -s flag. The value specified with -s is relative to the position of the tape's read/write head and not to an archive's position on the tape. For example, to restore the first, second, and fourth backups from a multiple-backup tape archive, the respective values for the -s flag would be -s 1, -s 1, and -s 2. -t Displays information about the backup archive. If the archive is in file system format, a list of files found on the archive is written to standard output. The name of each file is preceded by the i-node number of the file as it exists on the archive. The file names displayed are relative to the root (/) directory of the file system that was backed up. If the File parameter is not specified, all the files on the archive are listed. If the File parameter is used, then just that file is listed. If the File parameter refers to a directory, all the files contained in that directory are listed. If the archive is in file name format, information contained in the volume header is written to standard error. This flag can be used to determine if the archive is in file name or file system format. -T Displays information about the backup archive. If the archive is in file name format, the information contained in the volume header is written to standard error, and a list of files found on the archive is written to standard output. The File parameter is ignored for file name archives. If the archive is in file system format, the behavior is identical to the -t flag. -v Displays additional information when restoring. If the archive is in file name format and either the -x or -T flag is specified, the size of the file as it exists on the archive is displayed in bytes. Directory, block, or character device files are archived with a size of 0. Symbolic links are listed with the size of the symbolic link. Hard links are listed with the size of the file, which is how they are archived. Once the archive is read, a total of these sizes is displayed. If the archive is in file system format, directory and nondirectory archive members are distinguished. -x  Restores individually named files specified by the File parameter. If the File parameter is not specified, all the archive members are restored. If the File parameter is a directory and the archive is in file name format, only the directory is restored. If the File parameter is a directory and the archive is in file system format, all the files contained in the directory are restored. The file names specified by the File parameter must be the same as the names shown by the restore -T flag. Files are restored with the same name they were archived with. If the file name was archived using a relative path name (./filename), the file is restored relative to the current directory. If the archive is in file system format, files are restored relative to the current directory.  The restore command automatically creates any needed directories. When using this flag to restore file system backups, you are prompted to enter the beginning volume number.  The restore command allows for shell-style pattern matching metacharacters to be used when specifying files for archive extraction. The rules for matching metacharacters are the same as those used in shell pathname "globbing," namely:  asterick* (* ) Matches zero or more characters, but not a . (period) or / (slash). question mark (?) Matches any single character, but not a . (period) or / (slash). brackets ([ ]) Matches any one of the characters enclosed within the brackets. If a pair of characters separated by a dash are contained within the brackets, the pattern matches any character that lexically falls between the two characters in the current local. Additionally, a . (period) or a / (slash) within the brackets will not match a . (period) or a /  (slash) in a file name.  backslash (\) Matches the immediately following character, preventing its possible interpretation as a metacharacter. -X VolumeNumber Begins restoring from the specified volume of a multiple-volume, file name backup. Once started, the restore command behavior is the same as with the -x flag. The -X flag applies only to file name archives.  -y Continues restoring when tape errors are encountered. Normally, the restore command asks you whether or not to continue. In either case, all data in the read buffer is replaced with zeros. The -y flag applies only when the archive is in file system format. ? Displays a usage message.   Exit Status This command returns the following exit values:  Return code Description 0   Successful completion. >0   An error occurred.   Examples To list the names of files in either a file name or file system archive on diskette device /dev/rfd0, type the following command:   restore -Tq  The archive is read from the /dev/rfd0 default restore device. The names of all the files and directories contained in the archive are displayed. For file system archives, the file name is preceded by the i-node number of the file as it exists on the archive. The -q flag tells the restore command that the first volume is available and is ready to be read. As a result, you are not prompted to mount the first volume. To restore a specific file, type the following command:   restore -xvqf myhome.bkup system.data  This command extracts the file system.data into the current directory from the archive myhome.bkup. The archive in this example is in the current directory. File and directory names must be specified as they are displayed when using the -T flag. The -v flag displays additional information during the extraction. This example applies to both file name and file system archives. To restore a specific file from tape into the virtual media repository, type the following command:  restore -xvqf /dev/rmt0 /var/vio/VMLibrary/media_file To restore a specific directory and the contents of that directory from a file name archive, type the following command:  restore -xdvqf /dev/rmt0 /home/mike/tools  The -x flag extracts files by their file name. The -d flag tells the restore command to extract all the files and subdirectories in the /home/mike/tools directory. File and directory names must be specified as they are displayed when using the -T flag. If the directories do not exist, they are created. To restore a specific directory and the contents of that directory from a file system archive, type the following command:   restore -xvqf /dev/rmt0 /home/mike/tools  This command extracts files by file name. File and directory names must be specified as they are displayed when using the -T flag. If the directories do not exist, they are created. To restore an entire file system archive, type the following command:   restore -rvqf /dev/rmt0  This command restores the entire file system archived on tape device /dev/rmt0 the current directory. This example assumes you are in the root directory of the file system to be restored. If the archive is part of a set of incremental file system archives, the archives should be restored in increasing backup-level order beginning with level 0 (for example, 0, 1, 2). To restore the fifth and ninth backups from a single-volume, multiple-backup tape, type the following command:  restore -xvqs 5 -f/dev/rmt0.1  restore -xvqs 4 -f/dev/rmt0.1 The first command extracts all files from the fifth archive on the multiple-backup tape specified by /dev/rmt0.1. The .1 designator specifies that the tape device will not be retensioned when it is opened and that it will not be rewound when it is closed. It is necessary to use a no-rewind-on-close, no-retension-on-open tape device because of the behavior of the -s flag. The second command extracts all the files from the fourth archive (relative to the current location of the tape head on the tape). After the fifth archive has been restored, the tape read/write head is in a position to read the archive. Since you want to extract the ninth archive on the tape, you must specify a value of 4 with the -s flag. This is because the -s flag is relative to your position on the tape and not to an archive's position on the tape. The ninth archive is the fourth archive from your current position on the tape. To restore the fourth backup, which begins on the sixth tape on a 10-tape multiple-backup archive, put the sixth tape into the tape drive and type the following command:   restore -xcs 2 -f /dev/rmt0.1 /home/mike/manual/chap3  Assuming the fourth backup is the second backup on the sixth tape, specifying -s 2 advances the tape head to the beginning of the second backup on this tape. The restore command then restores the specified file from the archive. If the backup continues onto subsequent volumes and the file has not been restored, the restore command instructs you to insert the next volume until the end of the backup is reached. The -f flag specifies the no-rewind, no-retension tape device name.    The -s flag specifies the backup number relative to the tape inserted in the tape drive, not to the overall 10-tape archive. To improve the performance on streaming tape devices, pipe the dd command to the restore command and type the following command:   dd if=/dev/rmt0 bs=64b | restore -xf- -b64  The dd command reads the archive from the tape using a block size of 64 512-byte blocks and writes the archive to standard output. The restore command reads the standard input using a block size of 64 512-byte blocks. The value of the block size used by the dd command to read the archive from the tape must be an even multiple of the block size that was used to create the tape with the backup command. For example, the following backup command could be used to create the archive that this example extracts:   find /home -print | backup -ivqf/dev/rmt0 -b64  This example applies to archives in file name format only. If the archive was in file system format, the restore command should include the -B flag. To improve the performance of the restore command on 9348 Magnetic Tape Unit Model 12, you can change the block size by typing the following command:   chdev -l DeviceName -a BlockSize=32k To restore nonsparse database files, type the following command:   restore  -xef  /dev/rmt0 To restore files that were archived as sparse, type the following command:  restore  -xf  /dev/rmt0 To restore only the permissions of the files from the archive, type the following command:  restore -Pa -vf /dev/rmt0 To restore only the ACL attributes of the files from the archive, type the following command:    restore -Pc -vf /dev/rmt0 To view the table of contents along with the file permissions, type the following command:   restore -Ta -vf /dev/rmt0 To view the table of contents of a file name archive along with the time stamps and file permissions, type the following command:   restore -Tl -vf /dev/rmt0 To view the table of contents of a file system archive along with the time stamps and file permissions, type the following command:   restore -tl -vf /dev/rmt0   Related Information The  command.

 restorevgstruct command Purpose Restores the user volume group.   Syntax restorevgstruct { -ls | -vg VolumeGroupLabel  [ DiskName ... ] }   Description The restorevgstruct command restores the structure of a previously saved user volume group.  If the -ls flag is specified, a list of previously-saved volume groups and the date each volume group was saved is displayed.  This command does not work on rootvg.   Flags Flag name Description DiskName... Specifies the names of disk devices to be used instead of the 	disk devices saved in the volume group structure. Target disk devices must be defined as empty physical volumes; that is, they must contain a physical volume identifier and must not belong to a volume group. If the target disk devices belong to a volume group, they must be removed from the volume group using the reducevg command.  -ls Displays a list of previously saved volume groups. -vg Specifies the name of the VolumeGroup to restore.    Exit Status See .   Examples To restore the volume group myvg, onto the hdisk2 and hdisk3 disks, enter: restorevgstruct myvg hdisk2 hdisk3   To list all previously saved volume groups, enter: restorvgstruct -ls The message generated would be similar to:  -rw-r--r--   1 root     system        51200 Jun 18 10:53 myvg.data -rw-r--r--   1 root     system        51200 Jun 18 10:53 myvg2.data   Related Information The  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, and the  command.

 starttrace command Purpose Records selected system events.   Syntax starttrace  [  Event[, Event ] ...]    Description The starttrace command starts the trace daemon which configures a trace session and starts the collection of system events. The data collected by the trace function is recorded in the trace log. A report from the trace log can be generated with the  command.   Flags Flag name Description -event Event[,Event] Specifies the user-defined events for which you want to collect trace data. The Event list items should be separated by commas.

 svmon command Purpose Captures and analyzes a snapshot of virtual memory. Syntax   svmon   [   ] [   ] [   [  ] ] [  [  |  ] ]    svmon   [ -O  ] [ -i  [  ] ]    svmon  [ -O  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]     svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [  ] [ -O  ] [ -a  ] [ -t  ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -@ [ ALL |  ] ]    svmon  [   ] [ -i  [  ] ] [ -c <  > ] [ -O  ] Description The svmon command displays information about the current state of memory. The displayed information does not constitute a true snapshot of memory, however, because the svmon command runs at user level with interrupts enabled.  If you specify no flag, the svmon command, by default, reports real memory at the system level.   You can see memory consumption details and generate the following types of reports. To see more information about a type of report, select one of the following links:   The output of these reports can be in compact format or long format. To generate compact format report, specify the -O flag. If you do not specify the -O flag, the report is in long format. Command report The command report displays the statistics of memory use for the specified command. To print this report, specify the -C flag. The command report can be in compact format or in long format: Item Description Compact report A one line summary for each command. To set compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines report for each command that contains a summary, a size-per-page report, and the details of the segments. To set long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. Detailed segment report The detailed segment report displays detailed information about the primary segments that are specified. To print the detailed segment report, specify the -D flag.   The detailed segment report is in long report format only.  Global report The global report displays the statistics of the real memory and paging space that are in use for the whole system. If you do not specify any flag, the global report is the default format of report that the svmon command generates.  To print the global report, specify the -G flag.   The global report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A report on only the main metrics of the system. This report is one line with a maximum of 160 characters. Long report A summary of memory, page size, and affinity domain. The report is multiple lines, which is the default format of global report.  By default, the following metrics are displayed:  The memory metric displays the memory consumption of the machine. The Page Size metric displays the memory consumption of the Page Size. The Affinity Domain metric reports the memory affinity by affinity domain. Process report The process report displays the memory use for the specified active process. If you do not specify a list of processes, the svmon command displays the memory use statistics for all active processes.  To print the process report, specify the -P flag.  The process report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A one line report for each process. To set the compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines summary for each process. To set the long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. This report contains a summary for each process, a per-page-size report, and the details of the segments.  The svmon command does not show the decrease in the memory usage count when the application releases the memory. When the memory is released from the application, it goes back to the memory free list of the per-process. The svmon command accounts for the memory that is released as the allocated memory for that application. Segment report The segment report displays the statistics of memory use for the specified segments. To display the statistics for all of the defined segments, do not specify any list.   To print the segment report, specify the -S flag.   The segment report includes metrics for each specified segment. The report contains several lines of metrics for each segment. User report The user report displays the statistics of memory use for the specified users (login names). To display the statistics for all of the users, do not specify any list of login names.   To print the user report, specify the -U flag.   The user report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A one line report for each user. To set the compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines summary for each user. To set the long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. This report contains a summary for each user, a per-page-size report, and the details of the segments. Workload management class report The workload management class report displays statistics of memory use for the specified workload management classes. To display the statistics for all of the defined classes, do not specify any class.   To print the workload management class report, specify the -W flag.  Restriction: This report is available only when the  is running. If the  is not running, the following message is displayed and no statistics are reported:  WLM must be started If the  is running in passive mode, the svmon command displays the following message before displaying the statistics:  WLM is running in passive mode  The workload management class report can be in compact format or long format: Item Description Compact report A one line report for each class. To set the compact report as the default format, specify the -O flag. Long report A multiple lines summary for each class. To set the long report as the default format, do not specify the -O flag. This report contains a summary for each class, a per-page size report, and the details of the segments. Workload management tier report The workload management tier report displays information about the tiers, such as the tier number, the superclass name, and the total number of pages in real memory from segments belonging to the tier.  To print the tier report, specify the -T flag. Only the long report format is supported.  Restriction: This report is available only when the  is running. If the  is not running, the following message is displayed and no statistics are reported:  WLM must be started If the  is running in passive mode, the svmon command displays the following message before displaying the statistics:  WLM is running in passive mode XML report You can use the svmon command with an -X flag to generate a report in XML format. The XML report contains data of the global environment, the processes, the segments, the users, the workload management classes, and the commands running on the system.  The report is by default printed to the standard output. To print the output to a file named , specify the -O  flag. The extension of the output file will be .svm.  The .svm file uses an XML Schema Definition (XSD) that the /usr/lib/perf/svmon_schema.xsd file defines. You can use the XML data in the XML reports to build custom applications because the schema is self-documented.  In the XML report, if you do not specify the -O affinity argument, or set it to the off value, only the domain affinity at system level is reported. Flags If no command line flag is given, then the -G flag is the default.   Item Description  [ ALL |  ]  Displays report for the .   The -@ ALL option specifies to display the report for all of the s starting with the global report, and to process all of the available s, sorting them by the  name.  When you specify a list of  names in the  parameter, the  information is displayed in a header, and the report is displayed without adding  information. All information displayed is restricted to the  that was processed and has meaning only inside the . For example, the  displayed is virtual , which is the  inside the . The same rule applies to the  options. Each  name in the list is processed in the given order and each  report is separated by the  header.  When you do not specify a list, the command adds  information to existing reports. The pid section and segments section of the report contain the  name when one is available. Virtual  information might also be displayed.  When all of the keywords are used, the  command processes all of the available s, sorting them by the  name.   The -@ flag is not supported when executed within a . -a  Restricts the scope to the subclasses of the supclassname parameter (in the Tier report that is returned with the -T flag).  -c <  > Adds a comment, specified by the  parameter, into the XML report. Use the -c flag with the -X flag.  -C  Displays memory use statistics for the processes running the commands that are specified by the commands parameter. -D  Displays memory use statistics for the segments that the sids parameter specifies, and a detail status of all of the frames of each segment. -G Displays a global report. -i  [  ] Displays statistics repetitively.  The svmon command collects and prints statistics in the interval that the interval parameter specifies.   The numintervals parameter specifies the number of repetitions. If the parameter is not specified, the svmon command runs until you interrupt it (Ctrl+C).    The observed interval might be larger than the specified interval because it might take a few seconds to collect statistics for some options. -o  Specifies the output file with the  parameter for XML reports. Use this flag with the -X flag. -O  Changes the content and presentation of the reports that the svmon command generates. You can specifies values to the  parameter to modify the output.  To overwrite the default values that are defined previously by the -O  flag, you can define the .svmonrc configuration file in the directory where the svmon command is launched. -P [  ] Displays the memory-usage statistics for the processes that the pids parameter specifies. -S [  ] Displays the memory-usage statistics for segments that the sids parameter specifies. The sids parameter is a hexadecimal value. The segment IDs (SIDs) that are specified must be of primary segments. If you do not specify a list of SIDs, the statistics of memory use are displayed for all of the defined segments. -t  Displays the top object in the count parameter to be printed. -T [  ] Displays the memory-usage statistics of all of the classes of the tier numbers that the tiers parameter specifies. If you do not specify a list of tiers, the statistics of memory use are displayed for all of the defined tiers. -U [  ] Displays the memory-usage statistics for the login name that the lognames parameter specifies. If you do not specify a list of login identifiers, the statistics of the memory use are displayed for all of the defined login identifiers. -W [  ] Displays the memory-usage statistics for the  class that the classnames parameter specifies. If you do not specify a list of class names, the statistics of memory usage are displayed for all of the defined class names. -X Generates the XML report.

This is applicable to all the flags.  The program extracts statistics from the system with an interval specified by the monitoring_interval_in_seconds argument. The default output, as shown below, consists of two fixed parts and a variable section. The top two lines at the left of the display show the name of the system the topas command runs on, the date and time of the last observation, and the monitoring interval.  The second fixed part fills the rightmost 25 positions of the display.

If more than one subsection displays, they are always shown in the following order:  CPU Network Interfaces Physical Disks WorkLoad Management Classes Processes  When the topas command is started, it displays all subsections for which hot entities are monitored. The exception to this is the WorkLoad Management (WLM) Classes subsection, which is displayed only when WLM is active.  Parameter Description CPU Utilization  This subsection displays a bar chart showing cumulative CPU usage. If more than one CPU exists, a list of CPUs can be displayed by pressing the c key twice. Pressing the c key only once will turn this subsection off. The following fields are displayed by both formats:   User% This shows the percent of CPU used by programs executing in user mode. (Default sorted by User%) Kern% This shows the percent of CPU used by programs executing in kernel mode. Wait% This shows the percent of time spent waiting for IO. Idle% This shows the percent of time the CPU(s) is idle.  When this subsection first displays the list of hot CPUs, the list is sorted by the User% field. However, the list can be sorted by the other fields by moving the cursor to the top of the desired column. Network Interfaces  This subsection displays a list of hot network interfaces. The maximum number of interfaces displayed is the number of hot interfaces being monitored, as specified with the -nets flag. A smaller number of interfaces will be displayed if other subsections are also being displayed. Pressing the n key turns off this subsection. Pressing the n key again shows a one-line report summary of the activity for all network interfaces. Both reports display the following fields:  Interf The name of the network interface. KBPS The total throughput in megabytes per second over the monitoring interval. This field is the sum of kilobytes received and kilobytes sent per second.

KB-In The number of kilobytes received per second over the monitoring interval. KB-Out The number of kilobytes sent per second over the monitoring interval.  When this subsection first displays the list of hot network interfaces, the list is sorted by the KBPS field. However, the list can be sorted by the other fields by moving the cursor to the top of the desired column. Sorting is only valid for up to 16 network adapters.  Physical Disks This subsection displays a list of hot physical disks. The maximum number of physical disks displayed is the number of hot physical disks being monitored as specified with the -disks flag. A smaller  number of physical disks will be displayed if other subsections are also being displayed. Pressing the d key turns off this subsection. Pressing the d key again shows a one-line report summary of the activity for all physical disks. Both reports display the following fields: Disk The name of the physical disk. Busy% Indicates the percentage of time the physical disk was active (bandwidth utilization for the drive). KBPS The number of kilobytes read and written per second over the monitoring interval. This field is the sum of KB-Read and KB-Read. TPS The number of transfers per second that were issued to the physical disk. A transfer is an I/O request to the physical disk. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the disk. A transfer is of indeterminate size. KB-Read The number of kilobytes read per second from the physical disk. K -Writ The number of kilobytes written per second to the physical disk.  When this subsection first displays the list of hot physical disks, the list is sorted by the KBPS field. However, the list can be sorted by the other fields by moving the cursor to the top of the desired column. Sorting is only valid for up to 128 physical disks. WLM Classes  This subsection displays a list of hot WorkLoad Management (WLM) Classes. The maximum number of WLM classes displayed is the number of hot WLM classes being monitored as specified with the -wlmdisp flag. A smaller number of classes will be displayed if other subsections  are also being displayed. Pressing the w key turns off this subsection. The following fields are displayed for each class:   % CPU Utilization The average CPU utilization of the WLM class over the monitoring interval. % Mem Utilization The average memory utilization of the WLM class over the monitoring interval. % Blk I/O The average percent of Block I/O of the WLM class over the monitoring interval.  When this subsection first displays the list of hot WLM classes, the list will be sorted by the CPU% field. However, the list can be sorted by the other fields by moving the cursor to the top of the desired column.  Processes This subsection displays a list of hot processes. The maximum number of processes displayed is the number of hot processes being monitored as specified with the -procs flag. A smaller number of processes will be displayed if other subsections are also being displayed. Pressing the p key turns off this subsection. The process are sorted by their CPU usage over the monitoring interval. The following fields are displayed for each process:  Name The name of the executable program executing in the process. The name is stripped of any pathname and argument information and truncated to 9 characters in length. Process ID The process ID of the process. % CPU Utilization The average CPU utilization of the process over the monitoring interval. The first time a process is shown, this value is the average CPU utilization over the lifetime of the process. Paging Space Used The size of the paging space allocated to this process. This can be considered an expression of the footprint of the process but does not include the memory used to keep the executable program and any shared libraries it may depend on. Process Owner (if the WLM section is off) The user name of the user who owns the process. WorkLoad Management (WLM) Class (if the WLM section is on) The WLM class to which the process belongs.     Implementation Specifics Changes to WLM that are shown by topas (like adding new classes, or changing existing class names) will not be reflected after starting topas. You must stop topas and all clients which use Spmi, then restart after the WLM changes are made. This is also the case for Disks and Network Adapters added after topas or any other Spmi consumer is started.   Sample Default Output The following is an example of the display generated by the topas command:   Topas Monitor for host:    niller               EVENTS/QUEUES    FILE/TTY Mon Mar 13 15:56:32 2000   Interval:  2         Cswitch     113  Readch  1853576                                                 Syscall    2510  Writech   49883 CPU   User%   Kern%  Wait%  Idle%               Reads       466  Rawin         0 cpu0    7.0     4.0    0.0   89.0               Writes       12  Ttyout      706 cpu1    1.0     8.0    0.0   91.0               Forks         0  Igets         0 cpu2    0.0     0.0    0.0  100.0               Execs         0  Namei         0                                                 Runqueue    0.0  Dirblk        0                                                 Waitqueue   0.0 Interf   KBPS   I-Pack  O-Pack   KB-In  KB-Out lo0      100.4    45.7    45.7    50.2    50.2  PAGING           MEMORY tr0        2.0     4.4     3.4     1.4     0.6  Faults        1  Real,MB    1024                                                 Steals        0  % Comp     81.0 Disk    Busy%     KBPS     TPS KB-Read KB-Writ  PgspIn        0  % Noncomp  19.0 hdisk0    0.0      0.0     0.0     0.0     0.0  PgspOut       0  % Client    3.0 hdisk1    0.0      0.0     0.0     0.0     0.0  PageIn        0                                                 PageOut       0  PAGING SPACE WLM-Class (Active)  CPU%    Mem%     Disk%      Sios          0  Size,MB       0 System               8      41        12                        % Used Shared               1      24         9                        % Free                                                 NFS      calls/sec Name     PID      CPU%   PgSP  Class            ServerV2    0   Press: topas    (35242)  3.0    0.3   System           ClientV2    0   "h" for help.

This is also the maximum number of CPUs displayed when enough room is available on the screen. If this number exceeds the number of CPUs available, only the installed CPUs will be monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no CPU information is monitored.When you specify a single flag, the topas command will take that value and the other values will be the default values. This is applicable to all the flags. -disks Specifies the number of disks to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of disks displayed when enough room is available on the screen. When this number exceeds the number of disks installed, only the installed disks are monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no disk information is monitored. -interval  Sets the monitoring interval in seconds. The default is 2 seconds. -nets Specifies the number of hot network interfaces to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of network interfaces displayed when enough room is available on the screen. When this number exceeds the number of network interfaces installed, only the installed network interfaces will be monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no network information is monitored. -procsdisp  Displays the full-screen process display. This display shows a list of the busiest processes, similar to the process subsection on the default display, only with more columns showing more metrics per process. This list can be sorted by any column. -procs Specifies the number of hot processes to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of processes shown when enough room is available on the screen. If this argument is omitted, a default of 20 is assumed. If a value of 0 is specified, no process information will be monitored. Retrieval of process information constitutes the majority of the topas overhead. If process information is not required, always use this option to specify that you do not want process information. -wlmdisp Displays the full-screen WLM class display, which is a split display. The top part of the display shows a list of hot WLM classes, similar to the WLM classes subsection on the default display, but with enough space available to display the full class names. This list can be sorted on any column. The bottom part of the display shows a list of busiest processes, similar to the full screen process display, but only displays processes belonging to one WLM class (selected with the f key). -wlms Specifies the number of hot WorkLoad Management (WLM) classes to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of WLM classes displayed when enough room is available on the screen. If this number exceeds the number of WLM classes installed, only the installed WLM classes will be monitored and displayed. If this argument is omitted, a default of 2 is assumed. If a value of 0 (zero) is specified, no WLM class information is monitored. -filesys Specifies the number of file systems to be monitored. This is also the maximum number of file systems displayed when enough room is available. When this number exceeds the number of file systems mounted, only the mounted file systems are monitored and displayed. If you do not specify the -filesys flag, the default value is 2. If you specify a value of 0, the file system information is monitored. -tape Switches the tape display section between on and off in the main topas display. -fullscreen Specifies the full-screen display of the specified parameter. The following parameters can be specified: process, WLM, lpar, disk, net, CEC, vg, filesys, or tape. This list can be sorted by any column.process Displays the full screen Process screen. This display shows a list of the busiest processes. This is similar to the process subsection on the default panel, only with more columns showing more metrics per process. WLM Displays the full screen WLM Classes panel. The top part of the screen shows a list of hot WLM classes. This is similar to the WLM classes subsection on the default screen, but with enough space available to display the full class names. lpar Displays the full screen Logical Partition panel. In shared-memory mode, this screen displays information about I/O memory entitlement of the partition. disk Displays the full screen Disk Metrics panel (Disk Panel View). The screen reports disk service times, disk queuing metrics, and disk throughput. net Displays the full screen statistics for the shared Ethernet adapter on a Virtual I/O Server.  CEC Displays the Cross-partition Panel.  	Dedicated and shared partitions are displayed, and a set of aggregated values provide an overview of the entire hardware systems partition set. Certain values that are only available from the HMC platform can be set through the HMC console. vg Displays the Volume Group Panel. The panel reports the following metrics of the volume groups in the top section of the screen, and the same metrics of the logical volumes in the bottom section of the screen. filesys Displays full file system information. The screen reports file system service times, file system queuing metrics, and file system throughput. tape Displays the full screen tape screen. This reports bandwidth use of the tape device, the amount of data transferred (read or written) to the tape device, and the average number of transfers per second issued to the tape device.   Subcommands While topas is running, it accepts one-character subcommands. Each time the monitoring interval elapses, the program checks for one of the following subcommands and responds to the action requested.    Command Description a The a key shows all of the variable subsections being monitored (CPU, network, disk, WLM, and process). Pressing the a key always returns the topas command to the initial main display. c The c key toggles the CPU subsection between the cumulative report, off, and a list of the busiest CPUs. The number of busiest CPUs displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. d The d key toggles the disk subsection between a list of busiest disks, off, and the report on the total disk activity of the system. The number of busiest disks displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. h Show the help screen. n The n key toggles the network interfaces subsection between a list of busiest interfaces, off, and the report on the total network activity of the system. The number of busiest interfaces displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. w The w key toggles the WorkLoad Management (WLM) classes subsection on and off. The number of busiest WLM classes displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. p The p key toggles the hot processes subsection on and off. The number of busiest processes displayed will depend upon the space available on the screen. P The uppercase P key replaces the default display with the full-screen process display. This display provides more detailed information about processes running on the system than the process section of the main display. When the P key is pressed again, it toggles back to the default main display. W The uppercase W key replaces the default display with the full-screen WLM class display. This display provides more detailed information about WLM classes and processes assigned to classes. When the W key is pressed again, it toggles back to the default main display. L The uppercase L key replaces the current display with the logical partition display. f Moving the cursor over a WLM class and pressing the f key displays the list of top processes in the class at the bottom of the WLM screen. This key is valid only when topas is in the full-screen WLM display (by using the W key or the -wlms flag). q Quit the program. r Refresh the display. Arrow and Tab keys Subsections from the main display such as the CPU, Network, Disk, WLM Classes, and the full-screen WLM and Process displays can be sorted by different criteria. Positioning the cursor over a column activates sorting on that column. The entries are always sorted from highest to lowest value. The cursor can be moved by using the Tab key or the arrow keys. Sorting is only valid for 128 disks and 16 network adapters.   Exit Status See .

 uname command Purpose Writes to standard output the name of the operating system that you are using   Syntax uname [  ] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []   Description The machine ID number contains 12 characters in the following digit format: xxyyyyyymmss. The xx positions indicate the system and is always 00. The yyyyyy positions contain the unique ID number for the entire system. The mm position represents the model ID. The ss position is the submodel number and is always 00. The model ID describes the ID of the CPU Planar, not the model of the System as a whole.  You can use the uname -m command sometimes to determine which model you are using. The following list is not complete. Refer to hardware vendor supplied documentation for values in the range E0 - FF. Also note that not all machine types have a machine ID. Many new machines share a common machine ID of 4C.   Flags Flag name Description -a  Displays all information specified with the -m, -n, -r, -s, and -v flags. Cannot be used with the -x flag If the -x flag is specified with the -a flag, the -x flag overrides it. -F  Displays a system identification string comprised of hexadecimal characters. This identification string is the same for all partitions on a particular system. -f  Similar to the F flag, except that the partition number is also used in the calculation of this string. The resulting identification string is unique for each partition on a particular system. -l Displays the LAN network number. -L Displays LPAR number and LPAR name. If LPAR does not exist, -1 is displayed for LPAR number and NULL for LPAR name. -m Displays the machine ID number of the hardware running the system.   The -m flag cannot be used to generate a unique machine identifier for partitions in an LPAR environment. -M Displays the system model name. If the model name attribute does not exist, a null string is displayed. -n Displays the name of the node. This may be a name the system is known by to a UUCP communications network. -p  Displays the architecture of the system processor. -r Displays the release number of the operating system. -s Displays the system name. This flag is on by default. -u Displays the system ID number. If this attribute is not defined,  the output is the same as the output displayed by uname -m. -x Displays the information specified with the -a flag as well as the LAN network number, as specified by the -l flag.   Exit Status The following exit values are returned: Return code Description 0 Successful completion. >0 An error occurred.

 vmstat command Purpose Reports virtual memory statistics. Syntax   [ ] [  ] [  ] [ []] [  ] [  ] [ ] [  ] []  [{  |  }  | ALL] ALL] [] [] []   Do not use the  parameter and the  flag together inside . Description The  command reports statistics about kernel threads, virtual memory, disks, traps, and processor activity. Reports that are generated by the  command can be used to balance system load activity. These system-wide statistics (among all processors) are calculated as averages for values that are expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. The  command might return inconsistent statistics because the statistics are not read atomically.  If you run the  command without flags, the report contains a summary of the virtual memory activity since system startup. If you specify the -f flag, the  command reports the number of forks since system startup. The  parameter specifies the name of the physical volume.  The  parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report. If you do not specify the  parameter, the  command generates a single report that contains statistics for the time since system startup and then exits. You can specify the  parameter only with the  parameter. If you specify the  parameter, its value determines the number of reports that are generated and the number of seconds apart. If you specify the  parameter without the  parameter, reports are continuously generated. Do not specify a value of zero to the  parameter.  The kernel maintains statistics for kernel threads, paging, and interrupt activity, which the  command accesses by using the  kernel extension. The disk input/output statistics are maintained by device drivers. For disks, the average transfer rate is determined by using the active time and number of times information is being transferred. The percent active time is computed from the amount of time the drive is busy during the report.  Beginning with , the  command reports the number of physical processors consumed (pc), and the percentage of entitlement consumed (ec), in  environments. These metrics display on the  environments.   The report that is generated by the  command contains a system configuration row and column headings. The system configuration row has the following values:  lcpu Indicates the number of logical processors. mem Indicates the amount of memory. tmem Indicates the true memory size of the LPAR.   This flag is available only when  option is provided and Active Memoryâ¢ Expansion is enabled. ent Displays only when the partition is running with shared processor. drives Displays only when physical volume name is monitored. s Indicates the number of active . It is displayed only when the  flag is specified. memlim Indicates the limit of the memory resource of the . The limit is in megabytes (MB). This information is displayed only for the  with enforced memory resource limit. cpulim Indicates the limit of processor resource of the  in processor units. This information is displayed only for the  with enforced processor resource limit. rset Indicates the type of the rset registry that is associated with a . The type can be regular or exclusive. This information is displayed only for the s that are associated with a rset registry. mmode Indicates memory mode. This metric is displayed automatically in a system with Active Memory Sharing enabled. This metric is also displayed when -c option is used. mpsz Size of the memory pool in gigabytes. This metric is displayed only in shared-memory mode.  The column headings and their descriptions follow:  : Information about . It displays only when the-@ flag is specified.    name.   The   name indicates system-wide statistics. The   name indicates the statistics belong to Global only. When the  command is started with the  option and the  specific information is not available for a metric, then an en dash sign (-) is displayed instead of a value. When the  command is started with the   or started inside a , if the  information is not available for a metric, then that metric is marked with the at sign (@), and the system-wide value is displayed for that metric. If a metric is not supported, then a en dash sign (-) is displayed instead of a value.    kthr: Information about kernel thread states.  r Average number of runnable kernel threads over the sampling interval. Runnable threads consist of the threads that are ready but still waiting to run, and the threads that are already running. b Average number of kernel threads that are placed in the Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) wait queue (awaiting resource, awaiting input/output) over the sampling interval.  Memory: Information about the usage of virtual and real memory. Virtual pages are considered active if they are accessed. A page is 4096 bytes. avm Active virtual pages. fre Size of the free list.   A large portion of real memory is used as a cache for file system data. It is not unusual for the size of the free list to remain small.  Page: Information about page faults and paging activity. This information is averaged over the interval and given in units per second.  re Pager input/output list. pi Pages that are paged in from paging space. po Pages paged out to paging space. fr Pages freed (page replacement). sr Pages that are scanned by page-replacement algorithm. cy Clock cycles by page-replacement algorithm.  Faults: Trap and interrupt rate averages per second over the sampling interval.  in Device interrupts. sy System calls. cs Kernel thread context switches.  CPU: Breakdown of percentage usage of processor time.  us User time. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). sy System time. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). id Processor idle time. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). wa Processor idle time during which the system had outstanding disk/NFS I/O request. If the current physical processor consumption of the uncapped partitions exceeds the entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (pc). pc Number of physical processors used. Displayed only if the partition is running with shared processor. ec The percentage of entitled capacity that is consumed. Displayed only if the partition is running with shared processor. Because the time base over which this data is computed can vary, the entitled capacity percentage can sometimes exceed 100%. This excess is noticeable only with small sampling intervals. rc The percentage of processor resource that is used. This information is displayed only for the s with enforced processor resource limit.  Disk: Provides the number of transfers per second to the specified physical volumes that occurred in the sample interval. The parameter can be used to specify one to four names. Transfer statistics are given for each specified drive in the order specified. This count represents requests to the physical device. It does not imply an amount of data that was read or written. Several logical requests can be combined into one physical request. If the  parameter is used, the physical volume names are printed at the beginning of command execution.   If the -I flag is specified, an I/O oriented view is presented with the following column changes.  kthr The p column is displayed in addition to the r and b columns.  p Number of threads waiting for I/O messages to raw devices. Raw devices are those devices that are directly attached to the system. If the -W flag is specified along with the -I flag, an additional w column is also displayed along with the r, b, and p flags. w Number of threads that are waiting for the file system direct I/O and concurrent I/O (CIO). page New fi and fo columns are displayed instead of the re and cy columns.  fi File page-ins per second. fo File page-outs per second.  If the -c flag is specified, Active Memory Expansion view is presented with the following column changes.  memory The columns csz, cfr, and dxm are displayed besides columns avm and fre. csz Current compressed pool size, in 4K page units. cfr Free pages available in compressed pool, in 4K page units. dxm Deficit in Expanded Memory Size, in 4K page units. page New columns ci and co are displayed instead of re and cy columns. ci Number of page-ins per second from compressed pool. co Number of page-outs per second to compressed pool.  If while the  command is running, there is a change in system configuration that affects the output,  prints a warning message about the configuration change. It then continues the output after printing the updated system configuration information and the header.   If the -l flag is specified, an additional "large-page" section is displayed with the following columns: alp Indicates the number of large pages currently in use. flp Indicates the number of large pages on the large page freelist.    If the -p option is specified, additional lines of VMM statistics are displayed for the specified page sizes. With -I and -t options, the -p option produces an additional line for the specified page size. This line contains the following VMM statistics relevant to the specified page size: avm fre re fi fo pi po ci co fr sr cy   The display of the re, fi, fo, and cy options are affected by the -I option. The display of the re, ci, co, and cy options are affected by the -c option. If there is no resource control, then the avm and fre options are system-wide. Therefore, with the -@ option set, both the avm and fre options will be marked with the at sign (@).   These VMM statistics are preceded by a psz column and followed by an siz column. The description of these two columns follows: psz Page size (for example, 4 KB, 64 KB). siz Number of frames of the specified page size that exist on the system. With the -s option, the -p option produces a separate stanza of output that contains only the statistics relevant to the specified page size. This additional stanza is preceded by a page size header.  The -P option produces the following report for the specified page size: pgsz Indicates the page size (for example, 4 KB, 64 KB). Memory Indicates the memory statistics for the specified page sizes. siz The number of frames of the specified page size that exist on the system. avm Active virtual pages applicable to the specified page size. fre Size of the free list for the specified page size. Page Indicates the relevant page faults and paging activity for the specified page size. The page-related columns re, pi, po, fr, sr, cy, fi, fo, ci, and co are also applicable to this report. Flags  If the  (or ) flag is entered on the command line, then the system accepts the  (or ) flag and ignores other flags. If both the  and  flags are specified, the system accepts only the first flag and ignore the second flag.  Flag name Description -@  Reports the Virtual Memory activity of a :  The -@ ALL option indicates that the report pertains to the system and global environment, in addition to all of the  in the system.   The values that are system-wide statistics are marked with dash sign (-) against the  section. The -@ flag indicates that the activity is only for that . The system-wide statistics are marked with the at sign (@).  Do not use the -@ flag with any combination of the -i flag. -c Displays memory compression statistics with the new columns of output, csz, cfr, and dxm under the heading memory, and columns ci and co under the heading page instead of the columns re and cy.  This option is available only when Active Memory Expansion is enabled. -f Reports the number of forks since system startup. -i Displays the number of interrupts that are taken by each device since system startup.  The -I, -t, -w, and -l flags are ignored when they are specified with the -i flag. -I Displays I/O oriented view with the new columns of output, p under heading kthr,and columns fi and fo under heading page instead of the columns re and cy in the page heading. -l Displays an extra "large-page" section with the alp and flp columns. -p pagesize Appends the VMM statistics for the specified page size to the regular  output. -P pagesize Displays only the VMM statistics, which are relevant for the specified page size. -s Writes to standard output the contents of the sum structure, which contains an absolute count of paging events since system initialization. The -s flag can only be used with the -v flag. These events are described as follows:  address translation faults Incremented for each occurrence of an address translation page fault. I/O may or may not be required to resolve the page fault. Storage protection page faults (lock misses) are not included in this count. -s backtracks  Incremented for each page fault that occurs while resolving a previous page fault. (The new page fault must be resolved first and then initial page faults can be backtracked.) CPU context switches Incremented for each processor context switch (dispatch of a new process). decrementer interrupts Incremented on each decrementer interrupt. device interrupts Incremented on each hardware interrupt. executable-filled page faults Incremented for each instruction page fault. extend XPT waits  Incremented each time that a process is waited by VMM due to a commit in progress for the segments accessed. free frame waits Incremented each time that a process requests a page frame. The free list is empty, and the process is forced to wait while the free list is replenished. iodones Incremented at the completion of each VMM I/O request. mpc send interrupts Incremented on each mpc send interrupt. mpc receive interrupts Incremented on each mpc receive interrupt. page ins Incremented for each page read in by the virtual memory manager. The count is incremented for page ins from page space and file space. Along with the page-out statistic, this value represents the total amount of real I/O initiated by the virtual memory manager. page outs Incremented for each page that is written out by the virtual memory manager. The count is incremented for page outs to page space and for page outs to file space. Along with the page in statistic, this statistic represents the total amount of real I/O initiated by the virtual memory manager. paging space page ins Incremented for VMM initiated page ins from paging space only. paging space page outs Incremented for VMM initiated page outs to paging space only. pages examined by the clock VMM uses a clock-algorithm to implement a pseudo least recently used (lru) page replacement scheme. Pages are aged by being examined by the clock. This count is incremented for each page examined by the clock. pages freed by the clock Incremented for each page the clock algorithm selects to free from real memory. pending I/O waits Incremented each time that a process is waited by VMM for a page-in I/O to complete. -s phantom interrupts Incremented on each phantom interrupt revolutions of the clock hand Incremented for each VMM clock revolution (that is after each complete scan of memory). start I/Os Incremented for each read or write I/O request that is initiated by VMM. syscalls  Incremented for each system call. total reclaims Incremented when an address translation fault can be satisfied without initiating a new I/O request. This can occur if the page has been previously requested by VMM, but the I/O has not yet completed; or if the page was pre-fetched by VMM's read-ahead algorithm, but was hidden from the faulting segment; or if the page has been put on the free list and has not yet been reused. traps  Not maintained by the operating system. zero-filled page faults Incremented if the page fault is to working storage and can be satisfied by assigning a frame and zero-filling it.  compressed pool page ins  Number of page-ins from Compressed Pool since system boot. compressed pool page outs   Number of page-outs to Compressed Pool since system boot. -s When used with the -p pagesize option, the -s option appends the sum structure for the specified page size to the system-wide sum structure. This additional stanza is preceded by a page size header (for example, 4K pages). The following details are not be displayed in this pagesize-based stanza as these statistics are not related to page sizes:  Processor context switches Device interrupts Software interrupts Decrementer interrupts MPC-sent interrupts MPC-received interrupts Phantom interrupts Traps Syscalls   When the -s flag is used with the -@ ALL option, the system-wide statistics are repeated in the  section. When the -s flag is used with the  option, all metrics are reported and the system-wide statistics are marked with the at sign (@). When the -s flag is used with the -l flag, the  command displays the following metric:  large-page hi water count Specifies the maximum value of the large-page inuse count.   -S  Multiplies the statistics of the processor with a value of 10power. The default value of the power is 0. The following statistics are scaled:  us sy id wa pc ec   Do not use the -S flag with the -f, -s, -i, -v, or -p flags. When the -S flag is specified, the us, sy, id, and wa statistics change. By default, the us, sy, id, and wa statistics are relative to the processor consumption of . When the -S flag is specified with a value of power that is not equal to zero, these statistics will be relative to system-wide processor consumption. The value of power for -S flag can be only between 0 and 3.   -t Prints the time-stamp next to each line of output of . The time-stamp is displayed in the HH:MM:SS format.   Time stamp is not be printed if -f, -s, or -i flags are specified. -v Writes to standard output various statistics maintained by the Virtual Memory Manager. The -v flag can only be used with the -s flag.  If you specify the -v flag, the following statistics are displayed:  compressed percentage Percentage of memory used by compressed pages.  client filesystem I/Os blocked with no fsbuf Number of client filesystem I/O requests blocked because no fsbuf was available. NFS (Network File System) and VxFS (Veritas) are client filesystems. Fsbuf are pinned memory buffers used to hold I/O requests in the filesystem layer.  client pages Number of client pages.  compressed pages Number of compressed memory pages.  external pager filesystem I/Os blocked with no fsbuf  Number of external pager client filesystem I/O requests blocked because no fsbuf was available.

This option is allowed only with -I flag.   If Active Memory Expansion is enabled, the  reports memory statistics in the expanded view. However, if the environment variable AME_MEMVIEW is set to TRUE, the memory statistics  represent the true view. The AME_MEMVIEW environment variable has no impact on memory statistics reported using the -c option.   SecurityAny user can run the vmstat command. If the user is not a root user, the view will be limited to the user's own processes.  If  is activated and the vios.system.stat.memory role is attributed to the user, then that user can see the same view that the root user does.

The file must contain one configuration record for each resource to  be  changed,  and each  configuration  record  must  be for the same resource type. If the resource type is the managed system, then the file must  contain  only one configuration record. The format of a configuration record is as follows:  attribute-name=value,attribute-name=value,...<LF>  Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:  "attribute-name=value,value,...",...<LF>  When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  Depending on the shell being used, nested double quotation marks  may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a \ (back slash) character.   If '+=' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of '=', then  the  specified  value  is  added to the existing value for the attribute if the attribute is numerical.  If the attribute is a list, then the specified values are added to the existing list.   If  '-='  is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of '=', then the specified value is subtracted  from  the  existing  value  for  the  attribute  if  the attribute  is  numerical.  If the attribute is a list, then the specified values are deleted from the existing list.

The Virtual I/O Server logical partition only supports the dedicated memory mode. mem_weight The shared memory weight of the shared memory partition.  The memory weight is used to determine the priority of logical partitions in a memory pool for distributing memory. Valid values are 0 - 255.  The default value is 128.  name | lpar_name | lpar_id Name or ID of the logical partition to change (required)   This command uses the profile name and lpar_name interchangeably because this environment does not support multiple profiles per logical partition.  When using this command on the , you must specify the profile name and logical partition name or ID because it supports multiple profiles per logical partition. Â   new_name New name for the logical partition. paging_device The paging space device to use if a memory pool is used.  A paging space device is a block storage device that has been added to the memory pool and is not designated as a paging device for any other logical partition.  This attribute is optional.

Optional values are is_ieee, additional_vlan_ids, is_required and is_trunk. Valid values for is_ieee, is_trunk, and is_required" 0 - no  1 - yes  For example, 4/0/2//0/0 specifies a virtual Ethernet adapter with a virtual slot number of 4, is not IEEE 802.1Q enabled, has a port virtual LAN ID of 2, no additional virtual LAN IDs, it is not a trunk adapter, and is not required. Â   virtual_fc_adapters Comma-separated list of virtual fibre channel adapters.  Each item in this list has the following format:  virtual slot num/adapter_type/remote_lpar_id/ remote_lpar_name/remote_slot_num/wwpn_list/is_required Required values: remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, adapter_type, virtual_slot_num     You can specify either remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, or use them both, but at least one of the values is required.  Valid values for adapter_type: client server   If you specify a value for adapter type, the Integrated Virtualization Manager (IVM) requires the adapter type to be a client.  Optional values: wwpn_list, is_required, remote_slot_num   When you add a virtual fibre channel adapter, wwpn_list can be left blank to allow IVM to automatically assign worldwide port names to the client adapter.  If you leave wwpn_list blank and the virtual slot number specified for this adapter already contains a virtual fibre channel adapter, IVM will use the worldwide port names that are already assigned.  New worldwide port names will only be generated if it is a new adapter. If you specify a wwpn_list value, there must be exactly two values.  Each worldwide port name must be a 16-character hexadecimal value.  These values are not case sensitive.   Valid values for is_required:  0 - no  1 - yes A value of none or an empty string indicates that no virtual fibre channel adapters should be assigned.   If the logical partition being changed is the Virtual I/O Server, you cannot change the current configuration. The IVM handles the client and server adapter as a pair; thus, IVM handles modifications automatically. Â   virtual_scsi_adapters Comma-separated list of virtual SCSI adapters. Each item in this list has the format:  slot_num/adapter_type/remote_lpar_id/remote_lpar_name/ remote_slot_num/is_required  The attribute names are not present in the list, just their values are present. If an attribute is optional and is not to be included, then no value is specified for that attribute. For example, 2/client//lpar2/3/0 specifies a virtual client SCSI adapter with a virtual slot number of 2, a server partition name of lpar2, a server slot number of 3, and is not required. The server partition ID was omitted.  Required values: slot_num, adapter_type, remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name    You can specify remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, or both, but at least one of the values is required.  Optional values: is_required, remote_slot_num    IVM requires that virtual slot number 2 always contain a virtual SCSI adapter, so if you specify adapters in any other slots, the default adapter is still created in slot number 2.  If you use the chsyscfg command with an empty list for the virtual_scsi_adapters attribute, all virtual SCSI adapters are removed, except the default adapter.  Valid values for adapter_type:  client: client adapter server: server adapter, valid for Virtual I/O Server logical partitions only  Valid values for is_required: 0 - no 1 - yes Â  Attribute names for the managed system lpar_comm_default Returns the lpar_comm_ipaddr to using the default IP address configured on the system as reported by lstcpip -interfaces. Valid values: 1: Default IP address will be used. lpar_comm_ipaddr The IP address through which client logical partitions will communicate with the management logical partition. This is used primarily for dynamic LPAR. It is defaulted to the first IP address available on your system, but can be manually set if desired. If you set this manually and then change your systems IP address, you must update this value.   This attribute supports multiple IP addresses using a comma-separated list. new_name New name for the managed system pend_configured_max_lpars The maximum number of logical partitions which can be created after restarting the managed system.This option is deprecated. Instead use: chsyscfg -r prof with attribute "max_virtual_slots" value for partition 1. -i ConfigurationData This option allows you to enter configuration data on the command line, instead of using a file. Data entered on the command line must follow the same format as data in a file, and must be enclosed in double quotation marks.   When this option is used, only a single resource can be changed.    The -i and the -f options are mutually exclusive.   Exit Status This command has a return code of 0 on success.   Security This command is not accessible by users with the ViewOnly role.

 IVM mkgencfg command Purpose Performs the initial logical partition configuration for the managed system.  This command is operable only in an  environment.   Syntax mkgencfg -o init [-i "ConfigurationData" ] [ -m ManagedSystem ]   Description The mkgencfg command performs the initial logical partition configuration for the managed system.  As part of the initial configuration, virtual Ethernet adapters are created in the management partition.  The virtual Ethernet MAC address prefix can optionally be configured through this command.   Flags Flag name Description -o Operation 	 The type of operations: init - Perform initial logical partition configuration actions for the managed system  -i ConfigurationData The configuration data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in a comma separated value (CSV) format.   The format of a configuration record is as follows:   "attribute-name=value,attribute-name=value,..."    Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:    ""attribute-name=value,value,...",..."    When you specify a list of values, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  Depending on the shell being used, nested double quotation marks might need to be preceded by an escape character.   Valid Attributes for Configuration Data:   mac_prefix The prefix needs to be a 3 byte hexadecimal value. It specifies the first 2.5 bytes of the MAC address to be assigned to all virtual Ethernet adapters for this managed system. The value cannot be a multicast address (010000 bit must be off), and needs to be a private address (020000 bit must be on). For example, a valid MAC address prefix is 0642A0. pend_configured_max_lpars The maximum number of partitions supported by the management partition after the next restart. Â   virtual_eth_mac_base_value The virtual Ethernet MAC address base value is a per partition value.  The base value is used to build the MAC addresses for each virtual Ethernet adapter in that partition.  The base value is the first 5 bytes of the MAC address.  The virtual slot number of the virtual Ethernet adapter makes up the last byte. If you do not assign a base value, one is generated automatically using the following format: Base value = 0xSSSSSBBBBB Where SSSSS is the system wide MAC address prefix and BBBBB is a randomly generated sequence of bits (guaranteed to be unique within this physical system).   The system wide MAC prefix is randomly generated unless you override it using mkgencfg -o init -i mac_prefix. If the base value is automatically generated, then the MAC address format for a virtual Ethernet adapter is 0xSSSSSBBBBBNN, where NN is the slot number. If you specify the base value using mkgencfg for partition 1 or mksyscfg/chsyscfg for any other partition, then the format is 0xBBBBBBBBBBNN, where BBBBBBBBBB is the base value that you specified. If a virtual Ethernet adapter is in a slot greater than or equal to 256, then the slot number overflows into the base value, since it does not fit in 1 byte.  For example,  handles it as 0xBBBBBBBBBB00 + 0x00000000NNNN. The mkgencfg command is the only way to specify the base value for partition 1.  After this value is set, you cannot change it without losing all partition configuration. If you need to change the value, use the lpcfgop command. The value is set implicitly when mkgencfg is running. The value will be generated automatically, unless you specify the value. The mkgencfg command runs implicitly when you run your first change command. You can change the base value for any other partition, when the partition is powered off.   A side effect of setting the base value for partition 1 with mkgencfg, is that the system wide prefix is set to the first 2.5 bytes of the partition 1 base value.  As a result, there are restrictions on setting both mac_prefix and virtual_eth_mac_base_value with mkgencfg at the same time.  If you specify both, the mac_prefix value needs to be equal to the first 2.5 bytes of the virtual_eth_mac_base_value value.       -m ManagedSystem The name of the managed system.  This attribute is optional because there is only one system to manage. The name might either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt-mmm*ssssssss,  where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and ssssssss is the serial number of the managed system.   Exit Status This command has a return code of zero on success.   Security This command is not accessible by users with the ViewOnly role.   Examples To initialize the logical partition configuration for the managed system using defaults, type:  mkgencfg -o init   To initialize the logical partition configuration for the managed system with support for 17 partitions and a MAC prefix of 0x06ABC0, type:  mkgencfg -o init -i "pend_lpm_max_lpars=17,mac_prefix=06ABC0"   Parent topic:  Parent topic:

In shared processing mode, this refers to virtual processors. max_proc_units The maximum number of processing units for this partition Â  max_virtual_slots Maximum number of virtual I/O adapter slots.   The system determines this value. mem_mode The partition memory mode.  ded - dedicated memory shared - shared memory If the memory mode is shared, then the logical partition cannot be assigned any physical I/O slots or host Ethernet adapter resources, the proc_mode attribute on the logical partition must be shared, and a memory pool must exist.  If the memory mode is omitted, then it is assumed to be a dedicated memory mode. The Virtual I/O Server logical partition only supports the dedicated memory mode. mem_weight The shared memory weight of the logical partition that uses shared memory.  This attribute is used for determining the priority of logical partitions in a memory pool for distribution of memory. The weight must be a value from 0 - 255.

Optional values are additional_vlan_ids, and is_trunk. Valid values for is_ieee, is_trunk, and is_required:  0 - no  1 - yes For example, 4/0/2//0/0 specifies a virtual Ethernet adapter with a virtual slot number of 4, is not IEEE 802.1Q enabled, has a port virtual LAN ID of 2, no additional virtual LAN IDs, it is not a trunk adapter, and is not required. Â  virtual_fc_adapters Comma-separated list of virtual fibre channel adapters.  Each item in this list has the following format:  virtual slot num/adapter_type/remote_lpar_id/ remote_lpar_name/remote_slot_num/wwpn_list/is_required Required values: remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, adapter_type, virtual_slot_num     You can specify either remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, or use them both, but at least one of the values is required.  Valid values for adapter_type: client server   If you specify a value for adapter type, the Integrated Virtualization Manager (IVM) requires the adapter type to be a client.  Optional values: wwpn_list, is_required, remote_slot_num   When you add a virtual fibre channel adapter, wwpn_list can be left blank to allow IVM to automatically assign worldwide port names to the client adapter.  If you leave wwpn_list blank and the virtual slot number specified for this adapter already contains a virtual fibre channel adapter, IVM will use the worldwide port names that are already assigned.  New worldwide port names will only be generated if it is a new adapter. If you specify a wwpn_list value, there must be exactly two values.  Each worldwide port name must be a 16-character hexadecimal value.  These values are not case sensitive.   Valid values for is_required:  0 - no  1 - yes A value of none or an empty string indicates that no virtual fibre channel adapters should be assigned.   If the logical partition being changed is the Virtual I/O Server, you cannot change the current configuration. The IVM handles the client and server adapter as a pair; therefore, IVM handles changes automatically. Â  virtual_scsi_adapters Comma-separated list of virtual SCSI adapters. Each item in this list has the format:  slot_num/adapter_type/remote_lpar_id/remote_lpar_name/ remote_slot_num/is_required  The attribute names are not present in the list, just their values are present. If an attribute is optional and is not to be included, then no value is specified for that attribute. For example, 2/client//lpar2/3/0 specifies a virtual client SCSI adapter with a virtual slot number of 2, a server partition name of lpar2, a server slot number of 3, and is not required. The server partition ID was omitted.  Required values: slot_num, adapter_type, remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name    You can specify remote_lpar_id, remote_lpar_name, or both, but at least one of the values is required.  Optional values: is_required, remote_slot_num    IVM requires that virtual slot number 2 always contain a virtual SCSI adapter, so if you specify adapters in any other slots, the default adapter is still created in slot number 2.  If you use the chsyscfg command with an empty list for the virtual_scsi_adapters attribute, all virtual SCSI adapters are removed, except the default adapter.  Valid values for adapter_type:  client: client adapter server: server adapter, valid for Virtual I/O Server logical partitions only  Valid values for is_required: 0 - no 1 - yes work_group_id Valid values:  none: do not participate in the workload management group  1: participate in the workload management group -i ConfigurationData This option allows you to enter configuration data on the command line, instead of using a file. Data entered on the command line must follow the same format as data in a file, and must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  When this option is used, only a single resource can be changed.

 chlv command Purpose Changes the characteristics of a logical volume.   Syntax To change the name of a logical volume:  chlv {  NewLogicalVolumeName | -bbr value}LogicalVolume   Description The chlv command changes the characteristics of a logical volume according to the command flags. The LogicalVolume parameter can be a logical volume name or logical volume ID. The chlv command can rename and set the bad-block relocation (BBR) policy. Changing the name of a logical volume and setting the bad-block relocation policy are the only supported options.   A logical volume that has been assigned as a backing device cannot be renamed. Although supported, it is not recommended that the bad-block relocation policy be enabled on the Virtual I/O Server for Virtual Small Computer System Interface (VSCSI) devices. Instead, the bad-block relocation policy needs to be enabled for VSCSI devices on the client.  Doing so ensures that the bad-block relocation policy is enabled for VSCSI devices that use logical volumes and physical volumes as storage and provides better performance. Also, enabling the bad-block relocation policy is recommended for paging spaces used by .   Flags Flag name Description -lv Specifies the logical volume. -bbr Sets the bad-block relocation policy. The value can be either: yes (Causes bad-block relocation to occur.) no (Prevents bad block relocation from occurring.)   Examples To change the logical volume name from oldlv to newlv, type: chlv -lv newlv oldlv To enable the bad-block relocation policy for the logical volume testlv, type: chlv -bbr yes testlv To disable the bad-block relocation policy for the logical volume lv01, type: chlv -bbr no lv01   Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 cplv command Purpose Copies the contents of a logical volume to a new logical volume.   Syntax To Copy to a New Logical Volume   cplv [  VolumeGroup ] [  NewLogicalVolume |   Prefix ] SourceLogicalVolume   To Copy to an Existing Logical Volume   cplv [  ] SourceLogicalVolume DestinationLogicalVolume   Description  Do not copy from a larger logical volume containing data to a smaller one. Doing so results in a corrupted file system because some data is not copied.   The cplv command copies the contents of SourceLogicalVolume to a new or existing logical volume. The SourceLogicalVolume parameter can be a logical volume name or a logical volume ID. The cplv command creates a new logical volume with a system-generated name by using the default syntax. The system-generated name is displayed.   The cplv command cannot copy logical volumes which are in the open state, including logical volumes that are being used as backing devices for virtual storage.   Flags Flag name Description -f Copies to an existing logical volume without requesting user confirmation. -lv NewLogicalVolume Specifies the name to use, in place of a system-generated name, for the new logical volume. Logical volume names must be unique systemwide names, and can range from 1 to 15 characters. -prefix Prefix Specifies a prefix to use in building a system-generated name for the new logical volume. The prefix must be less than or equal to 13 characters. A name cannot be a name already used by another device. -vg VolumeGroup Specifies the volume group where the new logical volume resides. If this is not specified, the new logical volume resides in the same volume group as the SourceLogicalVolume.   Examples To copy the contents of logical volume fslv03 to a new logical volume, type:   cplv fslv03  The new logical volume is created, placed in the same volume group as fslv03, and named by the system. To copy the contents of logical volume fslv03 to a new logical volume in volume group vg02, type:   cplv  -vg vg02 fslv03  The new logical volume is created, named, and added to volume group vg02.

 cl_snmp command Purpose Issues Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests to agents and processes SNMP responses returned by agents.    Syntax cl_snmp [][ Level] [ TargetHost] [ TimeoutValue] [ RetryNumber] [ MaxRepetitions] [ ConfigurationFile] [ PortNumber] [ ] [ NonRepeaters] Function [MIBvariable][VariableType][Value][...]]    Description Use the cl_snmp command to issue SNMP requests to agents and to process SNMP responses returned by agents. The  cl_snmp command can be used for SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 requests.   Flags Flag name Description -com  Specifies the community name used to access the specified variables at the destination SNMP agent. If you do not specify a community name, the default name is public. Community names are not required when using the user-based security model.   Community names are case sensitive. -debug Level  Specifies a debugging level during run time. The default is 0. The higher the debugging level, the greater the number of messages that are displayed. The levels can be from 0 through 4. -host TargetHost   Specifies the target host to which you want to send a request. This can be an Internet protocol address, a host name, or a winSNMP name in the clsnmp.conf configuration file. If you do not specify a host, the default is the local host. -timeout TimeoutValue  Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) that the cl_snmp command waits for a reply from the SNMP agent. The default is 3. -retry RetryNumber  Specifies the maximum number of times to retry the command if it timed out. The default is 2. -max MaxRepetitions   Specifies the number of lexicographic successors to be returned for each variable binding pair after the first -non number successors. The parameter applies only to the getbulk request. This is ignored if the function request is not a getbulk request. For example, starting with successor -non number+1, return -max number of successors for each variable binding pair. The default is 10.  -file ConfigurationFile Specifies the full path and file name of the configuration file. -port PortNumber Specifies the number of the port that listens for traps. If a port number is not specified, the cl_snmp trap function listens on the well-known port 162, which is the default port for cl_snmp traps. -verbose  Specifies that the output from a request should be displayed using verbose output, for example, using the textual name instead of the MIB object identifier. -non NonRepeaters Specifies the number of variable binding pairs (name/value), starting with the first, for which only a single successor is returned. This parameter applies only to getbulk requests. This is ignored if the function request is not a getbulk request. The default is 0. Function [MIBvariable] [VariableType] [Value] [...]] Specifies the SNMP function or operation to perform, which is one of the following:  get  getnext getbulk  set  walk trap findname  MIBVariable  Specifies the Management Information Base (MIB) object, using its object descriptor (textual name), object identifier in ASN.1         notation, or a combination of the two. When used with the walk function, this is the MIB object prefix. A prefix can be any leading portion of  the complete object identifier. When used with the findname command, this object identifier is in the ASN.1 notation. Value Specifies the value to be set by the SET function. If white space is needed in the value, enclose the value in quotation marks. To set a variable to a value that is also a type, you must specify the type. VariableType Specifies the type of value being set. To complete an SNMP SET request, the SMI_type must be known. If no type is specified,             cl_snmp command searches first the /etc/mib.defs file and then the compiled MIB to determine the type. If the variable is not found, an error is returned. If a VariableType is specified, the VariableType  takes precedence over any type that may be assigned in the MIB. The VariableType and value must be compatible. For example, if you specify a type of number and a value of foo, an error is  returned because foo is not a number. VariableType is not case sensitive. Valid variable types are:       bitstring   counter counter32  counter64    display or displaystring  gauge gauge32  integer  integer32     ipaddress   nsapaddress    null    objectidentifier or OID     octetstring   opaque   opaqueascii   timeticks    uinteger             Request Types Request Type name Description findname  Sends a request that a search be done to obtain the textual name, for a given MIBVariable input, whose internal ASN.1 value best matches the input ASN.1 value. The search first checks the  /etc/mib.defs file, and if a matching textual name is not found, it continues with the compiled management information base (MIB). Only one MIBVariable is allowed per cl_snmp findname invocation. get   Sends a request to an SNMP agent for a specific MIB variable. The cl_snmp command then waits for a response or times out. getbulk  Obtains the value of the variables in the MIB tree specified by the object identifier (OID) or MIB variable name. A single getbulk performs the same function as a series of getnext commands, with fewer data exchanges between the cl_snmp command and the SNMP agent. getnext  Sends a request to an SNMP agent for the next MIB variable that lexicographically follows the MIBVariable specified. The cl_snmp command then waits for a response or times out. set  Sends a request to an SNMP agent to set a specific MIBVariable.  The cl_snmp command then waits for a response or times out. trap Listens for SNMP traps and displays trap information when they occur. Uses the default, well-known port 162 or the port number specified on the -port option.

 entstat command Purpose Shows Ethernet device driver and device statistics.   Syntax entstat [ -all ] [ -reset ] Device_Name   Description The entstat command displays the statistics gathered by the specified Ethernet device driver. The user can optionally specify that the device-specific statistics be displayed in addition to the device generic statistics. If no flags are specified, only the device generic statistics are displayed.   Flags Flag name Description -all Displays all the statistics, including the device-specific statistics. -reset Resets all the statistics back to their initial values.   Parameters Parameter name Description Device_name The name of the Ethernet device, for example, ent0.   Exit Status The statistic fields displayed in the output of the entstat command and their descriptions are as follows.  Some adapters may not support a specific statistic. The value of non-supported statistic fields is always 0.   Title Fields 	Field name Description Device Type Displays the description of the adapter type. Hardware Address Displays the Ethernet network address currently used 	by the device. Elapsed Time Displays the real time period which has elapsed since 	last time the statistics were reset. Part of the statistics may be reset by 	the device driver during error recovery when a hardware error is detected. 	There will be another Elapsed Time displayed in the middle of the output when 	this situation has occurred in order to reflect the time differences between 	the statistics.  	 Transmit Statistics Fields 	Field name Description Packets  The number of packets transmitted successfully by the 	device. Bytes The number of bytes transmitted successfully by the 	device. Interrupts The number of transmit interrupts received by the driver 	from the adapter. Transmit Errors  The number of output errors encountered on this device. 	This is a counter for unsuccessful transmissions due to hardware or network 	errors. Packets Dropped  The number of packets accepted by the device driver 	for transmission which were not (for any reason) given to the device. Max Packets on S/W Transmit Queue  The maximum number of outgoing packets ever queued to 	the software transmit queue. S/W Transmit Queue Overflow  The number of outgoing packets which have overflowed 	the software transmit queue. Current S/W+H/W Transmit Queue Length The number of pending outgoing packets on either the 	software transmit queue or the hardware transmit queue. Broadcast Packets The number of broadcast packets transmitted without 	any error. Multicast Packets  The number of multicast packets transmitted without 	any error. No Carrier Sense  The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	no carrier sense error. DMA Underrun The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	DMA underrun error. Lost CTS Errors  The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	loss of the Clear-to-Send signal error. Max Collision Errors The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to too 	many collisions. The number of collisions encountered exceeded the number 	of retries on the adapter. Late Collision Errors  The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to the 	late collision error. Deferred The number of outgoing packets deferred during transmission. 	Deferred means that the adapter had to defer while trying to transmit a frame. 	This condition occurs if the network is busy when the adapter is ready to 	transmit. The adapter will only defer the first attempt to send a packet. 	After that the adapter will transmit the packet without checking. If the network 	is still busy then a collision will be recorded. SQE Test Contains the number of "Signal Quality Error" Tests 	(i.e. Heartbeat) performed successfully during transmission. Timeout Errors The number of unsuccessful transmissions due to adapter 	reported timeout errors. Single Collision Count The number of outgoing packets with single (only one) 	collision encountered during transmission. Multiple Collision Count The number of outgoing packets with multiple (2 - 15) 	collisions encountered during transmission Current HW Transmit Queue Length  The number of outgoing packets which currently exist 	on the hardware transmit queue. CRC Errors The number of incoming packets with the Checksum (FCS) 	error. DMA Overrun The number of incoming packets with the DMA overrun 	error. Alignment Errors  The number of incoming packets with the alignment error. No Resource Errors  The number of incoming packets dropped by the hardware 	due to the no resource error. This error usually occurs because the receive 	buffers on the adapter were exhausted. Some adapters may have the size of 	the receive buffers as a configurable parameter. Check the device configuration 	attributes for possible tuning information. Receive Collision Errors  The number of incoming packets with the collision errors 	during the reception. Packet Too Short Errors The number of incoming packets with the length error 	indicating that the packet size is less than the Ethernet minimum packet size. Packet Too Long Errors  The number of incoming packets with the length error 	indicating that the packet size is bigger than the Ethernet maximum packet 	size. Packets Discarded by Adapter  The number of incoming packets dropped by the hardware 	for any other reasons. Receiver Start Count The number of times that the receiver (receive unit) 	on the adapter has been started.  	 Receive Statistics Fields			 			Field name Description Packets 							 The number of packets received successfully by the 								device. Bytes The number of bytes received successfully by the 								device. Interrupts The number of receive interrupts received by the 								driver from the adapter. Receive Errors  The number of input errors encountered on the 								device. This is a counter for unsuccessful reception due to 								hardware/network errors. Packets Dropped  The number of packets received by the device 								driver from this device which were not (for any reason) given to a 								network demuxer. Bad Packets The number of bad packets received (i.e. saved) by 								the device driver. Broadcast Packets 							 The number of broadcast packets received without 								any error. Multicast Packets The number of multicast packets received without 								any error. CRC Errors The number of incoming packets with the Checksum 								(FCS) error.

Receive Collision Errors  The number of incoming packets with the collision 								errors during the reception. Packet Too Short Errors The number of incoming packets with the length 								error indicating that the packet size is less than the Ethernet 								minimum packet size. Packet Too Long Errors The number of incoming packets with the length 								error indicating that the packet size is bigger than the Ethernet 								maximum packet size. Packets Discarded by Adapter The number of incoming packets dropped by the 								hardware for any other reasons. Receiver Start Count The number of times that the receiver (receive 								unit) on the adapter has been started. 		 General Statistics Fields			 			Field name Description No mbuf Errors The number of times that mbufs were not available 								to the device driver. This usually occurs during receive operations 								when the driver must obtain mbuf buffers to process inbound packets. 								If the mbuf pool for the requested size is empty, the packet will be 								discarded. The netstat -m command can be used to confirm 								this. Adapter Reset Count The number of times that the adapter has been 								restarted (re-initialized). Adapter Data Rate The maximum data rate of the adapter in Mbps 								(megabits per second). Driver Flags The device driver internal status flags that are 								currently turned on. 		 Device Specific Statistics Fields			 			This part of the display might be different for each type of adapter. It might 				contain adapter-specific information and extended statistics that were not included 				in the general statistics. Some adapters might not have any device-specific 				statistics. 			 Receive Address Match Errors statistic of devices might increase, when the adapter 				receives a unicast packet with a destination MAC address that does not match the MAC 				address of the adapter. This scenario might happen when an adapter is used by a 					 to bridge network 				traffic for client LPARs.

 optimizenet command Purpose Manages network tuning parameters.   Syntax optimizenet  [  |  ] {   Tunable[=NewValue] |  Tunable }   optimizenet  [ Tunable ]   optimizenet  [ Tunable ]   Description The optimizenet command is used to configure network tuning parameters. The optimizenet command sets or displays current or next boot values for network tuning parameters. This command can also make permanent changes or defer changes until the next reboot. Whether the command sets or displays a parameter is determined by the accompanying flag. The -set flag performs both actions. It can either display the value of a parameter or set a new value for a parameter.  If the -list flag is specified without any Tunables, only Tunables modifiable by this command will be displayed.   Flags Flag name Description -default Tunable Resets Tunable to its default value. If the Tunable needs to be changed (not currently set to its default value) and it is of type Reboot, it will not be changed; a warning displays instead. -h Tunable Displays help about Tunable parameter if one is specified.  -list [Tunable] Lists the characteristics of one or all Tunables, one per line, using the following format:   NAME                      CUR DEF BOOT MIN MAX  UNIT     TYPE     DEPENDENCIES  ------------------------------------------------------------------ General Network Parameters  -----------------------------------------------------------------  sockthresh                85  85  85   0   100  %_of_thewall D  -----------------------------------------------------------------  fasttimo                  200 200 200  50  200  millisecond  D  -----------------------------------------------------------------  inet_stack_size           16  16  16   1        kbyte        R  -----------------------------------------------------------------  where CUR  current value  DEF  default value  BOOT reboot value  MIN minimal value MAX maximum value  UNIT tunable unit of measure  TYPE Parameter type: D (Dynamic), S (Static), R (Reboot), B (Bosboot), M (Mount), I (Incremental), and C (Connect)  DEPENDENCIES List of dependent tunable parameters, one per line -perm Makes changes apply to both current and reboot values when used in combination with -set or -default. These combinations cannot be used on Reboot type parameters because their current value can't be changed. When used with -set without specifying a new value, values displays only if the current and next boot values for a parameter are the same. Otherwise NONE displays as the value. -reboot Makes changes apply to reboot values when used in combination with -set or -default. When used with -set without specifying a new value, next boot values for tunables display instead of the current values. -set Tunable [=NewValue ] Displays the value or sets the Tunable to NewValue. If a tunable needs to be changed (the specified value is different than current value), and is of type Reboot it will not be changed but a warning displays instead.  When -reboot is used in combination without a new value, the nextboot value for Tunable is displayed. When -perm is used in combination without a new value, a value displays only if the current and next boot values for tunable are the same Otherwise NONE displays as the value.   Network tunable parameters Parameter Description arptab_bsiz   Purpose: Specifies Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table bucket size. Values:  Default: 7  Range: 1 to MAXSHORT  Type: Reboot Diagnosis netstat -protocol arp will show the number of ARP packets sent and the number of ARP entries purged from the ARP table. If large number of entries are being purged, the ARP table size should be increased.  arptab_nb  Purpose: Specifies the number of ARP table buckets. Values:  Default: 73 Range: 1 to MAXSHORT Type: Reboot Diagnosis: netstat -protocol arp will show the number of ARP packets sent and the number of ARP entries purged from the ARP table. If large number of entries are being purged, the ARP table size should be increased.   Increase this value for systems that have a large number of clients or servers. The default provides for 73 x 7 = 511 ARP entries, but assumes an even hash distribution.   clean_partial_conns  Purpose: Specifies whether or not SYN (synchronizes the sequence number) attacks are being avoided.  Values:  Default: 0 (off) Range: 0 or 1 Type: Dynamic Tuning: This option should be turned on for servers that need to protect against network attacks. If on, randomly removes partial connections to make room for new non-attack connections.  net_malloc_police  Purpose: Specifies the size of the net_malloc and net_free trace buffers.  Values:  Default: 0 Range: 0 to MAXINT Type: Dynamic Tuning: If the value of this variable is non-zero, all net_malloc and net_free buffers will be traced in a kernel buffer and by system trace hook HKWD_NET_MALLOC. Additional error-checking will also be enabled. This includes checks for freeing a free buffer, alignment, and buffer overwrite. Enable this parameter only when investigating some network problem, because performance is affected negatively when turned on. The default value is zero (policing off). Values of net_malloc_police larger than 1024 will allocate that many items in the kernel buffer for tracing.  rfc1323  Purpose: Enables window scaling and time stamps as specified by RFC 1323 (TCP Extensions for High Performance). Window scaling allows the TCP window sizes (tcp_recvspace and tcp_sendspace) to be larger than 64KB (65536) and is typically used for large MTU networks.  Values:  Default: 0 (off) Range: 0 or 1 Type: Connect Tuning: The default value of 0 disables the RFC enhancements on a systemwide scale. A value of 1 specifies that all TCP connections will attempt to negotiate the RFC enhancements. Make changes before attempting to set tcp_sendspace and tcp_recvspace to more than 64 KB.   route_expire  Purpose: Specifies whether unused routes created by cloning, or created and modified by redirects expire.  Values:  Default: 1 (on) Range: 0 or 1 Type: Dynamic Tuning: A value of 1 allows route expiration, which is the default. Negative values are not allowed for this option.   tcp_pmtu_discover  Purpose: Enables or disables path MTU discovery for TCP applications. Values:  Default: 1 Range: 0 or 1 Type: Dynamic Tuning: A value of 0 disables path MTU discovery for TCP applications, while a value of 1 enables it.  tcp_recvspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket buffer size for receiving data. This affects the window size used by TCP.  Values:  Default: 16384 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Diagnosis: Setting the socket buffer size to 16 KB (16,384) improves performance over standard Ethernet and Token-Ring networks. Lower bandwidth networks, such as Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), or higher bandwidth networks, such as Serial Optical Link, should have different optimum buffer sizes. The optimum buffer size is the product of the media bandwidth and the average round-trip time of a packet.  For high-speed networks, like gigabit Ethernet or ATM 622, a value of 65536 should be used for the minimum size for best performance. For values larger than 65536, you must enable rfc1323 (rfc1323=1) to enable TCP window scaling.  tcp_sendspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket buffer size for sending data.  Values:  Default: 16384 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Tuning: This affects the window size used by TCP. Setting the socket buffer size to 16 KB (16,384) improves performance over standard Ethernet networks.  Lower bandwidth networks, such as Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), or higher bandwidth networks, such as Serial Optical Link, should have different optimum buffer sizes. The optimum buffer size is the product of the media bandwidth and the average round-trip time of a packet:  (optimum_window=bandwidth * average_round_trip_time) For high-speed networks, like gigabit Ethernet or ATM 622, a value of 65536 should be used for the minimum size for best performance. For values larger than 65536, you must enable rfc1323 (rfc1323=1) to enable TCP window scaling. udp_recvspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket-buffer size for receiving UDP data.  Values:  Default: 42080 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Diagnosis: Nonzero n in netstat -stats report of udp: n socket buffer overflows  Tuning: Increase size, preferably to multiple of 4096.   udp_sendspace  Purpose: Specifies the system default socket-buffer size for sending UDP data.  Values:  Default: 9216 bytes Range: 4096 to 1048576 Type: Connect Diagnosis: Increase size, preferably to multiple of 4096.     Exit Status See .   Examples To display the maximum size of the mbuf pool, type: optimizenet -set thewall   To change the default socket buffer sizes on your system, type:  optimizenet -reboot -set tcp_sendspace=32768 To use a machine as an internet work router over TCP/IP networks, type:  optimizenet -set ipforwarding=1     To list the current and reboot value, range, unit, type and dependencies of the arptab_bsiz parameter, type: optimizenet -list arptab_bsiz    To display help information on arptab_bsiz, type:   optimizenet -h arptab_bsiz      Related Information The  command, the  command, the  command, the  command, and the  command.

 ping command Purpose Sends an echo request to a network host.   Syntax ping [   ] [ ] [   PacketSize ] [  hostname/IP_addr ] Host [  Count ]   Description The ping command sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ECHO_REQUEST to obtain an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway. The ping command is useful for: Determining the status of the network and various foreign hosts. Tracking and isolating hardware and software problems. Testing, measuring, and managing networks.  If the host is operational and on the network, it responds to the echo. Each echo request contains an Internet Protocol (IP) and ICMP header, followed by a timeval structure, and enough bytes to fill out the packet. The default is to continuously send echo requests until an Interrupt is received (Ctrl-C).  The ping command sends one datagram per second and prints one line of output for every response received. The ping command calculates round-trip times and packet loss statistics, and displays a brief summary on completion. The ping command completes when the program times out or on receipt of a SIGINT signal. The Host parameter is either a valid host name or Internet address.  By default, the ping command will continue to send echo requests to the display until an Interrupt is received (Ctrl-C). Because of the load that continuous echo requests can place on the system, repeated requests should be used primarily for problem isolation.   Flags Flag name Description -n Specifies numeric output only. No attempt is made to look up symbolic names for host addresses. -r Bypasses the routing tables and sends directly to a host on an attached network. If the Host is not on a directly connected network, the ping command generates an error message. This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that no longer has a route through it. -s PacketSize Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data. -src hostname/IP_addr Uses the IP address as the source address in outgoing ping packets. On hosts with more than one IP address, the -src flag can be used to force the source address to be something other than the IP address of the interface on which the packet is sent. If the IP address is not one of the machine's interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent.

 seastat command Purpose Generates a report to view, per client, Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics.   Syntax To display Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics, per client.  seastat  Shared Ethernet Adapter device name [ |  searchtype=value ]  To clear all Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics that have been gathered per client.  seastat  Shared Ethernet Adapter device name    DescriptionThe  command generates a report to view, per client, shared ethernet adapter statistics. To gather network statistics at a per-client level, advanced accounting can be enabled on the Shared Ethernet Adapter to provide more information about its network traffic. To enable per-client statistics, the VIOS administrator can set the Shared Ethernet Adapter accounting attribute to enabled. The default value is disabled. When advanced accounting is enabled, the Shared Ethernet Adapter keeps track of the hardware (MAC) addresses of all of the packets it receives from the LPAR clients, and increments packet and byte counts for each client independently. After advanced accounting is enabled on the Shared Ethernet Adapter, the VIOS administrator can generate a report to view per-client statistics by running the seastat command.    Advanced accounting must be enabled on the Shared Ethernet Adapter before the seastat command can print any statistics. To enable advanced accounting on the SEA, enter the following command:  chdev -dev <SEA device name> -attr accounting=enabled   FlagsFlag name Description -d Shared Ethernet Adapter device name Specifies the device name of the Shared Ethernet Adapter. -n  Disables name resolution on the IP addresses. -c  Clears all of the per client Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics that have been gathered. -s searchtype=value Searchs for a specified value.   Exit Status The following exit values are returned: Return code Description 0 Successful completion. >0 Invalid flag, argument, or command failure   Examples To display Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics for sea0, type: seastat -d sea0    To clear the Shared Ethernet Adapter statistics for sea0, type: seastat -d sea0 -c To search a MAC address, type:seastat -d entX -s mac=XXXXXX To search for a vlan, type:seastat -d entX -s vlan=<0 to 4094> Parent topic:  Parent topic:          
 snmp_info command Purpose Requests or modifies values of Management Information Base (MIB) variables managed by a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent.   Syntax snmp_info [ get | next] [] [ Community] [ Level] [ HostName] [ ObjectFile] [ Tries] [ ] Variable.Instance  The following syntax is for the set option:  snmp_info  set [] [ Community] [ Level] [ HostName] [ ObjectFile] [ Tries] [ ] Variable.Instance=Value  The following syntax is for the dump option:  snmp_info  dump [] [ Community] [ Level] [ HostName] [ ObjectFile] [ Tries] [ ] [Variable.Instance]   Description The  command requests or modifies values for one or more Management Information Base (MIB) variables managed by a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent. This command may only be issued by a user with root privileges or by a member of the system group.   If you specify the get option, the  command requests information about one or more MIB variables from an SNMP agent.  If you specify the next option, the  command requests information from an SNMP agent about the instances following the specified instances. The next option makes it possible to obtain MIB values without knowledge of the instance qualifiers.   If you specify the set option, the  command modifies values for  one or more MIB variables for an SNMP agent. Only a few MIB variables are designated read-write. The agent that manages the MIB database may  take various actions as a side effect of modifying MIB variables. For example, setting the ifAdminStatus MIB variable to 2 will normally shut down a network interface. The action taken is determined by the implementation of the SNMP agent that manages the database.  If you specify the dump option, the  command can be used to traverse the entire MIB tree of a given agent. If a group is passed in as the Variable parameter, the  command will traverse that specified path of the MIB tree.  The  command has a debug facility that dumps the debug information for transmitted and received packets. The facility is enabled with the -debug flag.   Flags Flag name Description -com Community  Specifies the community name to be used to query. If you do not specify this flag, the default community name is public. -debug Level  Specifies the level of I/O debug information. Use one of the following values: 0 No debug information. 1 Port bindings and the number of bytes transmitted and received. 2 Level 1 plus a hexadecimal dump of incoming and outgoing packets. 3 Level 2 plus an English version of the request and response packets.  If you do not specify this flag, the default debug level is 0. -host HostName  Specifies the host name of the SNMP agent to be queried. If you do not specify this flag, the default host name is the host name of the system on which the user is currently logged. -file ObjectFile Specifies the name of the objects definition file. If you do not specify this flag, the default objects definition file name is /etc/mib.defs. -mode Option  Specifies the mode by which to access the MIB variables.  The value can be one of the following options: get Requests information about the specified MIB variables next Requests the instances following the specified instances set Modifies the specified write access MIB variables dump Dumps the specified section of the MIB tree    The option name can be specified by the minimum number of characters required to make it unique. If you do not specify this flag, the default mode is get. -retry Tries Specifies the number of times the  command transmits the SNMP request to the SNMP agent before ending with the message no SNMP response. If you do not specify this flag, the default number of tries is 3. -verbose  Specifies that the output from the  command be displayed in verbose mode. If you do not specify this flag, the information will not be displayed in verbose mode. -wait  Specifies the wait time in seconds for the response from the snmpd agent. If you do not specify this flag, the default wait time is 15 seconds.   Parameters Parameter Description Value Specifies the value to which the MIB Variable parameter is to be set. A value must be specified for each variable. If a value is not specified, the request packet will be invalid. Variable Specifies the name in text format or numeric format of a specific MIB variable as defined in the /etc/mib.defs file. If the option to the -mode flag is next or dump, the Variable parameter may be specified as a MIB group.  Instance Specifies the instance qualifier for the MIB Variable parameter.  The Instance parameter is required if the option to the -mode flag is  get or set. The Instance parameter is optional if the option to  the -mode flag is next or dump.   There should be no blank spaces in the Variable.Instance parameter sequence.  If the Instance parameter is not specified, do not place a period after the Variable parameter.  For further information, consult RFC 1213, which defines the Management Information Base (MIB) for network management, and RFC 1157, which defines the SNMP protocol for creating requests for MIB information and formatting responses.

 snmp_trap command Purpose The snmp_trap command generates a notification (trap) to report an event to the SNMP manager with the specified message.   Syntax snmp_trap   |       Description The snmp_trap command generates a notification (trap) to report an event to the SNMP manager with the specified message.   Flags Flag name Description -host HostName  Specifies to connect to the SNMP agent on the specified host. If you do not specify this flag, the default host is the local host. Host can be an IP address or a host name.  -com Community  Specifies the community name to use. This community must have been set  in the /etc/snmpdv3.conf file for SNMP version 3 file. You also have to have read-access privilege to at least the SNMP agent running on the specified host or local host. If you do not specify this flag, the default community name is "public". -debug  Enables the debug facility. -msg Message Defines the message that the  command will send. This value specifies the information the trap will hold. This information is in the text format. You must order this flag as the last one in the list when you specify this command. -target TargetHost Specifies the target network-manager host to which the trap message is sent. It is different from -host flag. If you do not specify the -host and -target flags, the trap is sent to the VIOS SNMP agent on the local host.   Exit Status See .   Examples To display the current system information and snmp configuration information, type the following command: snmp_trap -msg hello world   Related Information The  command and the  command.

 traceroute command Purpose Prints the route that IP packets take to a network host.   Syntax traceroute [  Hops ] [  ] [  Port ] [  Address ] Host [ PacketSize ]   Description The traceroute command attempts to trace the route an IP packet follows to an Internet host by launching UDP probe packets with a small maximum time-to-live (Hops parameter), then listening for an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from gateways along the way. Probes are started with a Hops value of one hop, which is increased one hop at a time until an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message is returned. The ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message indicates either that the host has been located or the command has reached the maximum number of hops allowed for the trace.  The traceroute command sends three probes at each Hops setting to record the following: Hops value Address of the gateway Round-trip time of each successful probe    If the probe answers come from different gateways, the command prints the address of each responding system. If there is no response from a probe within a 3-second time-out interval, an * (asterisk) is printed for that probe.   The traceroute command is intended for use in network testing, measurement, and management. It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation. Because of the load it imposes on the network, the traceroute command should not be used during normal operations or from automated scripts.  The traceroute command prints an ! (exclamation mark) after the round-trip time if the Hops value is one hop or less. A maximum time-to-live value of one hop or less generally indicates an incompatibility in the way ICMP replies are handled by different network software. The incompatibility can usually be resolved by doubling the last Hops value used and trying again.  Other possible annotations after the round-trip notation are as follows: !H Host unreachable !N Network unreachable !P Protocol unreachable !S Source route failed !F Fragmentation needed  If the majority of probes result in an error, the traceroute command exits.  The only mandatory parameter for the traceroute command is the destination host name or IP number. The traceroute command will determine the length of the probe packet based on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the outgoing interface. The UDP probe packets are set to an unlikely value so as to prevent processing by the destination host.   Flags Flag name Description -hops Max_ttl Sets the maximum time-to-live (maximum number of hops) used in outgoing probe packets. The default is 30 hops (the same default used for TCP connections). -num Prints hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numerically. This flag saves a name-server address-to-name lookup for each gateway found on the path. -port Port Sets the base UDP port number used in probes. The default is 33434. The traceroute command depends on an open UDP port range of base to base + nhops - 1 at the destination host. If a UDP port is not available, this option can be used to pick an unused port range. -src SRC_Addr Uses the next IP address in numerical form as the source address in outgoing probe packets. On hosts with more than one IP address, the -src flag can be used to force the source address to be something other than the IP address of the interface on which the probe packet is sent. If the next IP address is not one of the machine's interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent.   Parameters Parameter Description Host Specifies the de
